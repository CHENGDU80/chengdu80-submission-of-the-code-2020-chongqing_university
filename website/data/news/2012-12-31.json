[{"title": "Grievous U.S. Mistake to Have Kept Open Libya Outpost", "date": "2012-12-31", "time": "17:31:39", "content": "The State Department failed to fill a security gap at the U.S. mission in Benghazi before the Sept. 11 attack even though it knew the Libyan government was incapable of protecting the compound, a Senate report said today.  The report by the Senate  Homeland Security  and Governmental Affairs Committee said the State Department failed to meet staffing requests from its own security personnel and made the grievous mistake of not closing the Benghazi compound at least temporarily because of growing threats.  The system was in fact flashing red in Libya and Benghazi before the attack, said Senator  Joseph Lieberman , the committee chairman, at a news conference today. U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed in the attack on the mission compound and a nearby annex.  The Democrat-turned-independent lawmaker from  Connecticut , who is retiring from the Senate, said the reaction from the U.S. government to the security situation in Benghazi before the attack was woefully inadequate to the dangers the flashing light was indicating.  The report is largely consistent with the criticism of an independent review panel appointed by Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton . That panel, in a Dec. 18 report, found the State Department had grossly inadequate security in Benghazi and must correct systemic failures in the protection of diplomats.  Insufficient Assets  Senator  Susan Collins  of  Maine , the committees ranking Republican, said the Defense Department couldnt have responded with military forces in time to the initial attack that resulted in the death of Stevens and information specialist Sean Smith.  Yet Collins questioned why U.S. troops couldnt have responded in time to the second attack at a CIA annex that occurred several hours later. That attack killed two former Navy SEALs, Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, who were working as security personnel.  Collins said the Pentagon has insufficient assets to respond to attacks of this type.  The committees report calls for the Defense Department to station more troops and other assets within range on land and sea to protect and defend both Americans and our allies on the African continent.  Mid-Level Managers  Clinton, who is in the hospital for a blood clot related to a concussion she suffered, has agreed to testify to Congress on the Benghazi security lapses in January.  Lieberman said there was no evidence of direct responsibility by Secretary Clinton for the security lapses. Echoing the finding of the independent review panel, Lieberman said, It stopped, as far as we can see, at the mid-level managers.  An assistant secretary in charge of diplomatic security resigned from that post and three other officials were placed on administrative leave in the wake of the investigation, the State Department said Dec. 19.  Collins said its likely there are others that do need to be held accountable, though she said that decision should rest with Clinton.  The report also faults the Obama administration for giving inconsistent descriptions of the attack when it was clear to the intelligence community from the beginning that it was a terrorist act.  Initial talking points drafted by intelligence officials that were used in the initial days following the attack described the event as a spontaneous protest that spiraled out of control. Lieberman said the intelligence community should no longer be responsible for drafting unclassified talking points that other administration officials might use.

President  Barack Obama 's jocular mood gave it away. In New Year's Eve  remarks  to the nation about the state of negotiations over a  deficit-reduction  deal, the  president said  an agreement was in sight, \"but it's not done.\" Behind the scenes, though, aides circulated the key points of a pending deal that Senate Republican leaders had tentatively agreed to, having brought Vice President  Joe Biden  into rescue the talks on Sunday evening. Before we get to the fine print, here's the hedge: As of Monday afternoon, there was so much grumbling from the left that Obama felt he had to appear in public to sell the deal. He needs Democrats to back the package, the highlight of which is a tax increase for household earnings above $450,000 per year, because there won't be enough Republican support -- especially in the House, which has scheduled no vote tonight -- to seal the deal. The package, while more favorable to Democrats than to Republicans, comes with a dose of  castor oil . Any deal to avert the fiscal cliff was always going to have to appeal to lawmakers whose political leanings are between the 20-yard lines -- in other words, not so rigid that they can't swallow a tax increase or a spending cut of any size. This package is designed to do just that. It would raise about $600 billion in revenue by increasing tax rates to 39.6 percent on earnings above $400,000 for individuals and $450,000 for couples. It would reinstate tax provisions, ended by the Bush-era tax cuts, that had phased out personal exemptions and deductions for upper-income taxpayers. Taxes on dividends and  capital gains  would jump to 20 percent from 15 percent for the top five percent of taxpayers. Estate taxes would rise to 40 percent from 35 percent, with the exclusion from taxation remaining at $5 million, or $10 million for a couple. All tax rates, including for wage-earners above the new cutoff, would be made permanent. The alternative minimum tax would be stopped from hitting millions of middle-class households, and cuts in Medicare payments to physicians would be halted. Both those fixes would be permanent, as well. On the spending side, Obama played -- and won -- a strong hand. Expiring  unemployment benefits  would  wisely  be extended another year, as would tax credits to encourage production of renewable energy and research and experimentation. An array of tax credits enacted during the financial crisis to help low-income families, students and small-business owners would get another five years. More good news for Democrats: The package contains no new entitlement cuts and no reduction in cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients. All told, it appears to be a very nice belated Christmas present for congressional Democrats. But before you conclude that Obama outfoxed the Republicans, take a look at what's missing: The parties remain at odds over whether and how to stop $110 billion in automatic spending cuts in 2013. Republicans say that, to end the sequestration, as it's called, they want spending cuts of a similar scale elsewhere. The amount of new revenue, $600 billion over 10 years, is also far less than the $1.6 trillion in Obama's opening bid -- and even less than the $800 billion that House Speaker  John Boehner  once agreed to. Some Democrats are further miffed that the Republicans seem to have redefined the middle class as households earning more than $450,000. Worst of all, there is no increase in the debt ceiling. In February, Republicans hope to use the debt limit as leverage to force Democrats to find $1 in spending cuts (read: entitlements) for every $1 in new borrowing authority. That helps explain why the president somewhat awkwardly made his bully pulpit appearance at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, next to the White House, today. The purpose was to declare that, in Round Three of  Washington 's ongoing deficit-reduction match (current negotiations are Round Two, while Round One was the 2011 Budget Control Act, in which Congress agreed to $1.1 trillion in spending cuts), he will insist on more tax increases. Obama said he would be willing to overhaul Medicare, but that any reforms must go hand-in-hand with tax reforms that raise new revenue. And then came the kicker, aimed straight at hesitant Democrats, including Senator  Tom Harkin , the Iowa Democrat, and  some liberal bloggers , who think Obama has caved: \"If Republicans think I will finish the job of deficit reduction through spending cuts\" after this package is approved, he said, \"then they have another thing coming.\" Harkin (or any senator) can singlehandedly hold up a Senate vote on the deal under the rules for expedited action on legislation. After all this, though, doing so would take chutzpah -- and the willingness to take the blame for a stomach-churning market drop on Jan. 2.

Malawi devalued the kwacha by a third against the dollar onMay 7, a month after Banda took office, and agreed to let theexchange rate float to meet conditions set by the InternationalMonetary Fund. Since then, the currency has dropped 26 percentto 326 per dollar, making it the worst-performing unit in Africa . Inflation in the southern African nation surged to 33percent in November from 30.6 percent in the previous month.  I am the first one to agree devaluation has broughtsuffering, Banda said.

The group is also calling on Banda to reduce herbudget on travel and vehicles and cut back on governmentspending.  Banda said food shortages this year have added toconsumers woes.

Sherman, who along with teammate Brandon Browner testedpositive for an undisclosed substance, appealed last month basedon errors in the chain of custody of his sample and because ofmistakes made by the tester, ESPN said. News of the initial banwas reported Nov. 26 and the substance in question was theprescription drug Adderall, a stimulant used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, ESPN said.  We are very pleased that the hearing officer recognizedthat the egregious errors that occurred with Mr. Shermanscollection required overturning the NFLs discipline, Suh saidin a statement. Mr. Sherman provided honest testimony about aseverely flawed process, and the hearing officer found him to bea credible man.  George Atallah, a spokesman for the NFL PlayersAssociation, confirmed the ruling to  USA Today .  The NFLs drug agreement with its players union includes aconfidentiality agreement that precludes all parties, includingthe players, from discussing test results publicly.  We are reviewing the decision, but decline comment atthis time due to the confidentiality provision of the program, Greg Aiello , a spokesman for the NFL, said in an e-mail.  Dave Pearson, a spokesman for the Seahawks, said in an e-mail that the team would defer to the league.

We want to apologize, Seattle-based Amazon said. Weknow how critical our services are to our customers businesses,and we know this disruption came at an inopportune time for someof our customers.  Amazon, the largest online retailer, has billed its 6-year-old cloud-computing offering as a cheap and safe way forcustomers to outsource their data centers. Its a business thatmay bring in about $1.5 billion in revenue for Amazon in 2012,according to  Colin Sebastian , an analyst at Robert W. Baird &Co. in  San Francisco . Occasional outages can undermineconfidence in the service, which makes it possible for companieslike Netflix to run their operations via the Internet.  While Amazon Web Services accounts for a fraction of the$62 billion in sales analysts are projecting for the company in2012, the business is more profitable than the retailoperations. The segment has about a 10 percent operating margin,Sebastian said. That compares with a 1 percent  margin  expectedin 2012 for the entire company, according to the average ofanalysts estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Accidentally Deleted  The disruption began at at 12:24 p.m. Seattle time on Dec.24 and continued until the following day, according to Amazon.The problem was related to Amazons Elastic Load Balancingservice, which apportions demand for computing power among theservers that are most able to handle the work loads.  Amazon said that data was accidentally deleted in amaintenance process run by a small number of developers, whichprompted high latency and error rates for technology thatmanages the load balancers. At the peak of the event, 6.8percent of ELB load balancers were affected, the company said.  The outage occurred in the eastern U.S., where Amazon has data centers in northern  Virginia . That region was hit by stormsearlier this year that caused Netflix to lose control over streaming content for about three hours on June 29.

Thatlured the Coyotes from Phoenix, where the team had relocatedfrom Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 1996.  Football Stadium  Construction of a venue for the National Football LeaguesArizona Cardinals also began in 2003 in the city, financed bythe Arizona Sports and Tourism Authority, which is supported byits own taxes. Glendale paid for some surroundinginfrastructure. The team began playing at what is now known as University of Phoenix Stadium  in 2006.  The city also ventured into baseball, issuing debt in 2008to finance a $200 million spring-training facility calledCamelback Ranch for Major League Baseballs Los Angeles Dodgersand Chicago White Sox. Taxes from a planned adjacent developmentand aid from the state sports authority were to repay the debt.  The national economy and the citys development hopes beganto crumble before the first pitch was thrown at the ballpark.  Paying Losses  The owner of the Phoenix Coyotes sought bankruptcy courtprotection in 2009. The league purchased the team for $140million with Glendale agreeing to cover its losses to keep thefranchise playing at its arena -- $50 million over the past twoyears. While the Coyotes won the Pacific Division title lastseason, home-game attendance was the lowest in the 30-team NHL.  Development around the sports facilities stalled. TheWestgate City Center, a mixed-use retail project adjacent to thehockey arena, wasnt fully built when the lender repossessed theproperty last year. A sports-themed project of housing, retail,lodging and office space around the spring training facilitynever materialized.  The economy crashed so fast and so hard, said GlendaleCity Councilwoman Yvonne Knaack, who has served since 2007.There was supposed to be this huge development to supportCamelback Ranch, she said. Now, around the ballpark, itsall field, all empty.  Building Permits  The value of building permits in Glendale plummeted to $118million in fiscal 2011 from $582 million in 2007 as a FreddieMac Arizona home price index  fell  51 percent from May 2006 toAugust 2011, wiping out six years of gains. Sales-tax revenuefell to $53.8 million in 2010 from $65.6 million in 2008. Debtpayments have depleted the reserve fund, which had $70 millionin 2007, said Diane Goke, the citys chief financial officer.  In May, confronting a $32 million deficit, Glendale fired49 workers -- the latest in cuts that have eliminated about 300jobs and trimmed operating costs by 25 percent, Goke said. Italso moved forward on an arena lease with potential Coyotesbuyer Greg Jamison, the former San Jose Sharks chief executiveofficer who has a tentative agreement with the league.  Under a lease approved Nov. 27, Glendale will pay the teaman average of $15 million annually to manage the rink. Thisyears amount will be less because of a lockout that hascanceled play so far this season. Though Horatio Skeete, theacting city manager, estimated it would cost $6 million to runthe arena without the Coyotes playing there, the city projectsit will be financially better off in the long term by providinghome ice to the team.  Rating Cuts  The municipalitys general-obligation bond rating was cuttwo steps by S&P on Dec. 12 to A-, four levels above non-investment grade. That followed a Moodys downgrade on Nov. 30to A2, its sixth-highest rank. Both companies cited declines inGlendales reserve fund from the payment for the Coyotes and theeffects of the 18-month recession that ended in June 2009.  After the rating cuts, Glendale sold about $240 million ofexcise-tax revenue bonds to refund previously issued debt, datacompiled by Bloomberg show. Debt maturing in nine years waspriced to yield 2.53 percent, or 1.15 percentage points morethan  benchmark AAA munis  with similar maturities, the data show.  That extra yield penalty was 0.08 percentage point higherthan what investors demanded on similar-maturing Glendaleexcise-tax debt sold in January, data compiled by Bloombergshow.  Glendale is a good example -- and hopefully a warningsign to others -- that when you deviate from your core purpose,you increase your risk, said Alan Schankel, managing directorof fixed-income research at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC inPhiladelphia.  Refinancing Savings  Still, the refinancing will save the city $9.5 million inthe current fiscal year and $43 million through 2038, Goke said.The city was also able to issue all its securities, unlike inthe January sale, when much of the deal went unsold.  The fact that we sold all of our bonds and we actuallygot a pretty good rate for them shows that investors are willingto invest in the city of Glendale and believe in the long-termsuccess of the city, she said.  Those savings, coupled with new development on the horizonbode well for the city, Goke said. Part of the vacant landaround the baseball facility was recently purchased, while aplan has been announced to build a 500-bed hospital near thehockey rink. A  Tanger Factory Outlet Centers Inc. (SKT)  mall openednear the arena in mid-November.  Knaack, the councilwoman, said she regrets approving thebaseball stadium, though she still sees the chance for economicgain from the hockey arena.  Were stuck with it, Knaack said. But on the otherhand, look at the potential we have. To me, we have a lot morepotential because of it.  Following is a pending sale:  FAIRFAX COUNTY, VIRGINIA plans to sell about $300 millionin general-obligation bonds as soon as Jan. 9, according to datacompiled by Bloomberg. Moodys Investors Service rates the debtAaa, its highest grade. (Added Dec. 28)  To contact the reporters on this story:Amanda J.

The 69- year-old  money manager  says the bull market that began in March 2009 resembles advances that pushed equities up more than threefold in the 1980s and fourfold in the 1990s.  Were still very comfortable with the market, Birinyi said in a telephone interview on Dec. 20. Our view all along since 2009 is that were in the midst of a protracted bull market, similar to 1982 and 1992, markets that went on for four or five years.  Equity Value  More than $8.4 trillion has been restored to U.S. share values since the rally began, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The  S&P 500  slipped 1.9 percent to 1,402.43  last week , trimming its 2012 increase to 12 percent.  The benchmark gauge rose 1.7 percent to 1,426.19 today as Congress worked to reach a budget agreement. Senate Republican Leader  Mitch McConnell  said lawmakers had reached an agreement on all tax issues and were very, very close to a deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff.  Banks and brokerages led the  2012 rally , rising 25 percent, followed by companies dependent on  consumer spending , whose shares climbed 19 percent. The S&P 500s advance in 2012 exceeded the average prediction of 12 Wall Street strategists tracked by Bloomberg at the start of the year, who called for a rise of 6.9 percent to 1,344.  General Motors  Companies highlighted by Birinyi at the start of the year have posted mixed returns. General Motors Co. and BlackRock Inc., which he recommended buying in January, are up 37 percent and 15 percent, respectively, while two other picks, Research In Motion Ltd. and Peoples United Financial Inc., declined 19 percent and 6.9 percent.  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , Birinyi Associates biggest stock holding as of Sept. 30, has climbed 26 percent in 2012, though its down 24 percent during the fourth quarter. The firm also had $34 million in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust at the last reporting date. The exchange-traded fund increased 12 percent this year.  Were still bullish, said Birinyi, who twice in 2012 said it was possible the S&P 500 would rise above 1,700 should economic growth accelerate. Now, he says, odds the index surpasses its old record of 1,565.15 set on Oct. 9, 2007, are greater than 50 percent as investors pile in.  What keeps things going forward is more acceptance when we start to see the individual come back somewhat, when we see people redoing their asset allocations, he said. When we look at parallels to previous markets, we find them.  Exodus Reversal  Birinyi is predicting a reversal of the exodus from equities by smaller investors that has accompanied the S&P 500s advance. More than $275 billion was withdrawn from U.S. stock mutual funds over the last four years and daily volume on American exchanges has  averaged  6.4 billion in 2012, the lowest level since at least 2008.  Concern President  Barack Obama  and Congress will fail to compromise in budget negotiations has pulled the S&P 500 down 3 percent since reaching a two-month high on Dec. 18. The impasse last week sent the  Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX) , a gauge of prices to protect equities against losses, to its biggest increase since August 2011, a month in which the threat of a U.S. default erased $1.1 trillion from stocks.  Back then, you had a massive drop in stocks because you had a crisis of confidence in the government, Roger Pine, a financial adviser at  College Station , Texas-based Briaud Financial Advisors, which oversees about $500 million, said in a telephone interview. In the short term, were looking at 2011 as the most direct and relevant precedent to today.  Tax Increases  The president returned from his holiday in  Hawaii  on Dec. 27 as lawmakers disputed which party would be responsible for missing the deadline for a debt deal, a failure that could hurt the U.S. credit rating and cause an economic recession. About $600 billion of tax increases and spending cuts will automatically take effect should no compromise be found.  Birinyi was bullish following the August 2011 rout in equities, saying on Sept. 12, 2011, that American companies were earnings too much money for the bull market to be derailed. Since then, earnings at S&P 500 companies have grown for another three quarters, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Analysts predict profits will rise 5.2 percent this year to a record $103.41 a share,  implying a price-earnings ratio  of 13.6 for the S&P 500, about 17 percent below the six-decade average of 16.4. Gross domestic product will expand 2 percent in 2013 and 2.8 percent in 2014, according to the median response in a survey of 86 economists by Bloomberg.  Expectations are for a gradual improvement for the  U.S. economy  once we pass this point of uncertainty, which will have a positive effect on the U.S. economy and follow through to global markets, Chad Morganlander, a  Florham Park , New Jersey- based  fund manager  at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., which oversees about $136 billion in client assets, said in a Dec. 27 in a phone interview. The worlds not going to end yet.  U.S. Economy  The U.S. housing market stagnated until this year, with a Dec. 28 report from the National Association of Realtors showing its index of pending sales of previously owned homes climbed 1.7 percent in November to 106.4, the highest level since April 2010. Home sales are picking up as  consumer confidence  reached an eight-month high earlier this month, according to the Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index.  If you look beyond the fiscal cliff you see the U.S. economy is actually getting better, David Joy, the Boston- based chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial Inc., which oversees about $680 billion, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Dec. 28. You see that in housing. You see that in manufacturing, he said. Stocks are going to have a good year.  European stocks have surged in the second half of 2012. The  Stoxx Europe 600 (SXXP)  is up 19 percent since June 4, advancing as the  European Central Bank  introduced bond-buying programs, S&P upgraded  Greece s debt and German business confidence rose more than forecast. The benchmark gauges 14 percent advance for the year is the best annual return since 2009.  Market Gaps  The S&P 500 took about 25 years to reach a new high after the Great Depression and since then, it has taken three years on average for the index to surpass previous records, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its been more than five years since the October 2007 high. The S&P 500 took about seven years in the 1970s and 2000s to exceed old highs.  For the  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU) , still 8.7 below its high in October 2007, it has taken about six-and-a-half years to surpass previous highs. Should stocks follow that path, the Dow wouldnt post a new record until the middle of 2015.  Right now, everything is just still very reluctant, Birinyi said. And when that changes, stock prices go higher. And where it ends in 2013? I really dont think it does.

The Boise, Idaho-based schools decision, which wasannounced yesterday in a  joint statement  on the Mountain Westwebsite, comes as the Big East tries to survive several schoolsdepartures due to lost revenue opportunities associated with anew college football playoff format.  Without question, conference affiliation has been anodyssey for Boise State, with all the unexpected turns andchanges that term suggests, Boise State University PresidentRobert Kustra said. The benefits of geographic footprint,revenue, and national exposure have to be balanced against thechanging circumstances of conference realignment.  Boise State said a year ago it would join the  Big East  infootball and the Big West in all other sports.  Even though it never played a game as a league member, itwill have to pay a $5 million exit fee to the Big East, thoughthere are contract provisions that may lower the amount and theMountain West is expected to help with the payment, ESPN said,citing unidentified people.  The Providence, Rhode Island-based Big East will lose itsstatus as an automatic qualifier for college footballslucrative Bowl Championship Series when a new playoff systembegins in 2014. The Mountain West also lacks an automaticqualifier for the playoff.  Still Scheduled  Central Florida, Houston, Memphis, San Diego State andSouthern Methodist are scheduled to join the Big East forfootball in July 2013; Tulane and East Carolina in July 2014;and Navy in July 2015. Those moves would create a 12-team leaguethat also includes Connecticut, Cincinnati, South Florida andTemple.  Boise State is the most recent school to withdraw from theBig East in the past two years. Texas Christian announced planto join before moving to the Big 12 instead; Rutgers is movingto the Big Ten; and Louisville is joining the Atlantic CoastConference.  The Big Easts seven non-football schools -- DePaul,Georgetown, Marquette, Providence,  Seton Hall ,  St. Johns  andVillanova -- voted unanimously this month to leave theconference to pursue a new basketball framework.  With the addition of San Jose State and Utah State on July1, 2013, the Mountain West will have 10 all-sport schools andHawaii as a football-only school. The other members will be  AirForce , Colorado State, Fresno State,  Nevada ,  New Mexico , Nevada-Las Vegas and  Wyoming .  Maintaining the Broncos program as part of the alreadysolid foundation we have established creates a posture of greatstability for the Mountain West going forward, saidCommissioner Craig Thompson.

Death Watch  The important and telling thing is that Maduro didnt goback to Venezuela, said Russ Dallen, head bond trader atCaracas Capital Markets, in an Dec. 31 interview from Miami.Why would he not come back unless its death watch?  Maduro said that he had met with Chavezs medical teamseveral times since flying to Cuba on Dec. 29, and that Chaveztold him personally about the new complications. Maduro didntprovide details on the developments.  Weve decided to stay in  Havana  for the coming hours toaccompany the comandante and the family, staying on top of theevolution of his current situation, Maduro said.  Chavez, who named his socialist revolution after the 19th-century South American liberator  Simon Bolivar , was last seen inpublic boarding a Cuba-bound plane Dec. 10. The Venezuelangovernment today released a statement it said was by Chavez inwhich he congratulated Cuba on the 54th anniversary of itsrevolution.  Fraternal Solidarity  On this very special Jan. 1, when the circumstances ofthe fight for life have united the Cuban and Bolivarianrevolutions more than ever, we come together in prayer and inhope to celebrate our fraternal solidarity, said thestatement, which was e-mailed to media.  Chavez said on Dec. 8 that voters should elect Maduro toprotect his legacy if his illness prevents him from remaining inoffice.  Caracas Mayor  Jorge Rodriguez , a top Chavez ally, canceleda New Years Eve concert in downtown Caracass Plaza Bolivar,asking that people gather to pray for Chavezs health instead,the mayors office said in a Twitter message.  Chavez suffered complications during his fourthoperation for cancer on Dec. 11 due to bleeding, Maduro saidDec. 13. Surgeons took corrective measures in time to controlthe bleeding, he said.  Stable Condition  A week later, Information Minister Ernesto Villegas saidthat Chavez was in stable condition after his medical teamcontrolled a respiratory infection.  By Dec. 24, Maduro told state television that Chavez hadrecovered enough to talk with him for about 20 minutes,including 15 minutes the former paratrooper devoted to givingeconomic instructions.  Venezuela s leader was in good spirits,walking and doing some exercises, Maduro said.  Should Chavez die, the manner in which power is passed to anew leadership may depend on whether Diosdado Cabello is re-elected as National Assembly president in a vote scheduled forJan. 5, said Dallen.  Under the constitution, if Chavez is unable to start hisnew term on Jan. 10 and doesnt step down, the National Assemblypresident must determine if the absence is temporary orpermanent. If his absence is deemed permanent, the head ofparliament must call for an election within 30 days, thoughCabello wields sufficient power to delay the vote and remain inpower, Dallen said.  Chosen Successor  While Chavez earmarked Maduro as his successor, Cabello, aformer lieutenant who fought alongside Chavez in a 1992attempted coup, is by no means out of the picture, Dallen said.  Maduro and Cabello are both moving their players on thegrand chessboard, Dallen said. Its in Cabellos intereststo play the long game. Its in Maduros interests for things tohappen more rapidly because the government is popular right nowand hes the chosen successor.  Cabello said Dec. 26 that Chavezs electoral victoryoutweighs swearing-in protocol and that the constitution doesntdictate the time and place of the ceremony.  Whats true is that everything points to 2013 being ahard year of big changes, opposition leader Henrique Capriles Radonski, who lost to Chavez by more than 10 percentage pointson Oct. 7, wrote on his blog yesterday in an end-of-year messagetitled 2013: The future is ours.

Countrywide Loan Probe Ended by House Panel With No Action Taken  A U.S. House panel ended a probe of alleged preferentiallending by Countrywide Financial Corp. to lawmakers and aideswithout taking action, saying the serious matters submittedfor review fall outside its jurisdiction.  Allegations surrounding mortgage loans to House members andstaffers through Countrywide Chief Executive Officer AngeloMozilos Friends of Angelo initiative or other so-called VIPprograms are either too old or involve people no longer employedin the House, the Ethics Committees Republican chairman andranking Democrat said in a statement Dec. 27.  Ethics Committee Chairman Jo Bonner of  Alabama  andRepresentative Linda Sanchez of California said the committeeconducted its own review of the role of Countrywides VIP unit,finding that while it offered quicker, more efficient processingand some discounts, the loans met basic underwriting standardsand didnt offer the best deals available in the marketplace.  The Senate Ethics Committee completed an investigation in2009 saying lawmakers including former Banking CommitteeChairman Christopher Dodd and Senator Kent Conrad didnt violaterules when they refinanced loans with Countrywide.  Fannie Mae, which bought billions of dollars in mortgagesfrom Countrywide under an exclusive agreement, has been underU.S. conservatorship since September 2008.

There is an inadequate connection between New York andthe events at issue in the case, with only e-mails and phonecalls taking place in New York, the Appellate Division of thestate Supreme Court said in a decision Dec. 27.  Porsche asked the appeals court in November to reverse alower courts decision rejecting its motion to dismiss the 2011suit by 26 hedge funds including David Einhorns GreenlightCapital Inc.  The funds, which had bet that Volkswagen stock would fall,claimed Stuttgart, Germany-based Porsche misled investors bydenying through much of 2008 that it intended to  acquire Volkswagen, which is based in Wolfsburg,  Germany , and by usingmanipulative trades to hide its stock positions. The plaintiffssought more than $1 billion in damages.  The appeals court said witnesses and documents in the caseare located in Germany, which provides an adequate alternativeforum.  Robert Giuffra, an attorney for Porsche at Sullivan &Cromwell LLP, described the decision in a statement as animportant victory for Porsche.  Porsche is also being sued in  Europe  over the issue.

The findings of a private survey modeled on the U.S.Federal Reserves Beige Book also question the recoverysstaying power. Improvements in retailing, real estate and miningin the fourth quarter were countered by rising inventories andlower corporate borrowing, according to the China Beige Bookreport issued last week.

The five-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed toreceive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, gained fourbasis points to 3.67 percent as of 10:30 a.m. in  Shanghai , thebiggest increase since Dec. 14, according to data compiled byBloomberg. It climbed 86 basis points this year.  The Peoples Bank of  China  said it will stick to a prudentmonetary policy next year and try to stabilize growth, rebalancethe economy and contain inflation. The four-paragraph statementreleased late Dec. 28 after a quarterly meeting of the monetarypolicy committee, mostly reiterated the stance set out at agovernment work conference earlier this month.  Temporary Shortage  The PMI reading of manufacturing from HSBC and MarkitEconomics was 51.5 in December, compared with the 50.9preliminary level and a final 50.5 in November. Fifty is thedividing line between expansion and contraction.  The seven-day  repo rate , which measures interbank fundingavailability, rose 46 basis points to 4.58 percent today, aweighted average compiled by the National Interbank FundingCenter shows. The measure dropped 102 basis points, or 1.02percentage points, in 2012.  The cash shortage is only temporary before the holiday,said He. Cash supply may rebound in the second week ofJanuary.  The  yuan  strengthened 0.06 percent to 6.2282 per dollar,bringing gains this year to 1.1 percent, according to the ChinaForeign Exchange Trade System. The currency appreciated 4.7percent last year and 3.6 percent in 2010. It reached 6.2223 onNov. 27, the highest level since the country unified officialand market exchange rate sin 1993.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.14 percent to6.3272 per dollar, a 1.6 percent discount to the onshore spotrate. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected movesin exchange rates used to price options, declined four basispoints to 1.80 percent.  The yield on the 2.95 percent government bonds due August2017 dropped four basis points to 3.17 percent, according to theInterbank Funding Center.  -- Judy Chen .

Clinton has suffered no neurological damage or stroke, is in good spirits and is expected to make a full recovery, Dr. Lisa Bardack of the Mt. Kisco Medical Group and Dr. Gigi El- Bayoumi of George Washington University said in the statement released by the State Department on Dec. 31. There was no additional information released yesterday.  Clintons hospitalization in  New York City  on Dec. 30 fueled concerns about the health of the former first lady and U.S. senator from  New York  who among Democrats has been mentioned as a potential 2016 presidential candidate. In a Gallup poll of Americans released over the weekend, she ranked as the most admired woman in the world for the 11th year in a row.  In the course of a routine follow-up MRI on Sunday, the scan revealed that a right transverse sinus venous thrombosis had formed, her doctors said, describing that as a clot in a vein found in the space between the brain and the skull behind the right ear.  David Langer, a neurosurgeon who isnt involved in Clintons care, said in an interview that the prognosis is quite good when such a blockage is caught early. This rare type of clot may be due to Clintons dehydration, which her spokesmen said happened during a recent stomach virus, and also can occur in cancer patients, said Langer, director of cerebrovascular research at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, New York.  Good News  Its really good news that it didnt result in a stroke, said Gholam Motamedi, a neurologist at Medstar Georgetown University Hospital in  Washington , who also isnt involved in Clintons care.  Her doctors said in the statement that they are working to dissolve the clot with blood thinners and that Clinton will be released from New York-Presbyterian Hospital once the proper medication dose has been established.  In all other aspects of her recovery, the secretary is making excellent progress and we are confident she will make a full recovery, Bardack and El-Bayoumi said. She is in good spirits, engaging with her doctors, her family, and her staff.  Clinton, 65, has been in the hospital for observation of the blood clot. Officials said she sustained a concussion in a fall while sick with the stomach virus.  Questions Raised  The doctors not involved in the case raised questions about whether there may be a serious underlying cause of the clot, such as cancer, and said further blockages could be potentially dangerous.  A concussion isnt known to increase the risk of this type of blood clot and a magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, scan isnt standard procedure to look for one, Motamedi said in a telephone interview. Blood thinners are used to make sure such a clot doesnt get any bigger and cut off the brains blood flow or cause further damage, he said.  Its important to look into the possible underlying causes, he said. If you find them, you have to focus on treating the underlying cause as well as prevent a recurrence.  The condition isnt common, and I hope there is no underlying malignancy or serious problems, he said.  Ultimately, its not the concussion that caused this, Langer said in an interview. Its unclear what the circumstances were surrounding her fall. Usually a skull fracture is associated with it. No one has mentioned that. I dont want to say she had one.  Less Clear-Cut  Allen Taylor, chief of cardiology at Medstar Georgetown University Hospital, said he wondered if the clot wasnt the original problem -- that she fell related to this problem and then never really had a concussion. This is far more complex and a little less clear-cut as to the cause.  The outside doctors said they see no reason at present to think this health scare will hinder Clinton in the future.  This shouldnt affect her ability to serve our country or do whatever she wants to do in four years, as long as she is well managed medically, Langer said.  Successor Named  Clinton said months ago she wouldnt continue in her post during a second term for President  Barack Obama , and he announced Dec. 21 that he will nominate Senator  John Kerry , a Massachusetts Democrat, to succeed her. Clintons aides have disclosed scant details about her initial illness and the subsequent complications.  As with chief executive officers such as the late  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  co-founder Steven Jobs, speculation about the health of a public figure has repercussions.  Her situation has remarkable, complex implications for politics and business around the world, and the process of government in the  United States , said Scott Sobel, president of Media & Communications Strategies based in Washington. Her immediate and long-term condition is really important for a number of stakeholders, even -- and its a very, very long list -- of other countries.  An administration official who has been monitoring Clintons progress said that at no point has she been incapacitated. The period when Clinton was least able to work was when she had the stomach virus, according to the official, who asked not to be identified discussing her health.  Regular Touch  Throughout, Clinton has been keeping in regular touch with senior leadership at the State Department and the White House, according to the department.  Clinton has experienced a blood clot before. In 1998, while she was first lady, she had the most significant health scare Ive ever had, she told the New York Daily News in an October 2007 interview. She recalled suffering what the newspaper described as terrible pain behind her right knee.  She thought she simply needed rest until a White House doctor told her to rush to Bethesda Naval Hospital, in nearby Bethesda,  Maryland , where doctors diagnosed a large blood clot behind her right knee.  The absence of detailed information on her current condition until the latest report from Clintons physicians left an information vacuum.  Speculation filled media from the Daily Beast website to the tabloid National Enquirer, whose cover screamed Hillary Clinton Brain Cancer Drama! Assistant Secretary of State Philippe Reines called the Enquirer report absolute nonsense.  Seven Statements  The administration official said Clintons media team has tried to be forthright, issuing seven statements in the three- and-a-half weeks she has been ill, every time there has been a shift in her condition. The continued questions might be driven in part by the intense public and media interest in Clinton and her husband, former President  Bill Clinton , the official said.  In an interview, crisis-management specialist Jamie Moss said Clintons team could have quelled rumors more effectively by having an attending physician issue a statement on her condition, as the State Department did Monday.  Its also important to consider even though shes a major public figure with major public obligations, at the same time shes a private citizen and should be afforded the same rights of privacy of any citizen, said Moss, founder and president of newsPRos, a national media relations and crisis-management firm based in New York.  Crisis management experts such as Sobel and  Jim Moorhead , co-chairman of the crisis-management practice at the law firm Steptoe & Johnson LLP in Washington, found no fault in the way Clintons team has responded.  Timely Information  Hillary Clinton may have a health crisis, but right now she doesnt have a communications crisis, Moorhead said in a telephone interview before the latest statement. The balance for any public official in addressing health issues is to be a timely source of accurate information. So far, I think that has occurred.  Clarence Jones, author of Winning with the News Media: A Self-Defense Manual When Youre the Story, said his advice to clients is to tell them everything because otherwise there will be a lot of speculation that the situation is worse than it is.  My attitude about any media relations is that you need to tell them everything because they will eventually find out, particularly if theres a lot of media focus on a person or an event, he said in a telephone interview from Holmes Beach,  Florida .

Even if they reach a last-minute budget agreement, it would be short of the so-called grand bargain of deficit reduction lawmakers envisioned.  Instead, a deal would be the least common denominator, blunting only some of the recession-causing policies Congress imposed as unthinkable consequences to force compromise. Further, any deal reached just before or after tonights deadline would set another deadline in early 2013 when lawmakers will again fight over the debt ceiling.  Trying to settle things and trying to find common ground is more than a work of art -- its almost impossible, said Ben Nelson, a  Nebraska  Democrat who is retiring from Congress after 12 years in the Senate. This Congress has continued to create a level of uncertainty that is just so unfortunate.  Senators worked through the weekend without an agreement. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, said today, negotiations are continuing as I speak, and that he hoped for an agreement before the end of the day. He and Republican leader Mitch McConnell of  Kentucky  were still haggling over income tax rates, estate taxes and spending cuts as Vice President Joe Biden was enlisted to help fashion a deal.  Common Deadline  It wasnt supposed to come down to the final minutes. Congress and President  Barack Obama  created the so-called fiscal cliff of more than $600 billion in tax increases and spending cuts by enacting laws in 2010, 2011 and 2012 that shared a common deadline of January 2013.  That was part coincidence and part intentional. The idea was to force a bipartisan deficit reduction deal by making the alternative untenable for either party: simultaneous tax increases at all income levels and spending cuts that would harm national defense.  Lawmakers could then replace the sudden deficit reduction of the fiscal changes with more gradual policies. What a deal will get them instead is some deficit reduction, some economic slowdown and little clear policy about the nations fiscal future.  The U.S. budget deficit has exceeded $1 trillion for each of the four years Obama has been in office.  Market Reaction  Stocks rose. The Standard & Poors 500 Index gained 0.3 percent to 1,406.47 at 10:09 a.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 4.69 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 12,942.80 today. The benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yield increased two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.72 percent at 9:35 a.m. in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.  The president and lawmakers yesterday sought to assure taxpayers and investors that a deal extending some tax cuts and other expiring provisions will happen -- if not by Jan. 1 then soon after a new Congress convenes Jan. 3.  Whats been holding us back is the dysfunction here in  Washington , Obama said yesterday on NBCs Meet the Press.  Still, the impasse has deepened concerns about another recession as the economy is showing signs of a rebound. It also has led to worries about dysfunction in Congress and Speaker John Boehners ability to control the Republican-led House of Representatives. Further, it could complicate Obamas second- term agenda as he seeks an immigration policy overhaul and stricter firearms limits.  Self-Inflicted Wounds  Lord, show them the right thing to do and give them the courage to do it, Senate chaplain Barry Black said yesterday in his opening prayer for the first Sunday session since Oct. 29, 2000, in which both the House and Senate cast votes. Save us from self-inflicted wounds.  Even if Congress avoids or patches the pain scheduled to take effect in January, the wrangling foreshadows more spending fights to come early in 2013.  The public is justifiably angry, and we are putting the nation at risk, said Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat.  By February, Congress will battle anew over raising the nations debt limit -- potentially replaying a 2011 standoff between the parties that went down to the wire, resulting in a credit downgrade and creation of the fiscal-cliff mechanism.  The Treasury Department says the U.S. will run out of room to finance deficits early in 2013, and the Congressional Budget Office pegs the date as early as mid-February.  Debt Limit  Republicans are insisting on spending cuts equal to the size of the debt limit increase, a rule that created the automatic cuts set to take effect in January. Obama says he wont negotiate on the debt ceiling; he hasnt said what that means.  With the sequester -- the automatic spending cuts that will affect military and other programs in 2013 -- unlikely to be resolved by a last-minute deal now, Republicans and Democrats also are poised for a fight over which cuts to stop and how.  A two-percentage-point cut in the payroll tax is slated to expire, and there is a bipartisan lack of enthusiasm for its extension, meaning higher taxes will take effect for all workers with the first paycheck of 2013.  Tax Increase  Without an agreement, taxes would rise by more than $3,400 per household in 2013, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. The tax and spending changes that would start taking effect at midnight would probably cause a recession in the first half of 2013, according to the Congressional Budget Office.  Provisions affecting businesses, inheritances and Medicare payments to doctors also would be affected if Congress doesnt act.  Senate leaders McConnell and Reid gathered members yesterday in Washington to tell them they were at a standstill.  The sticking points included whether to extend tax cuts on family income up to $250,000 a year or to a higher threshold, and whether to press for reductions in the growth of entitlement spending now or as part of the debt-limit fight next year.  Durbin told reporters yesterday that Republicans had offered to let taxes expire on household income over $500,000 Democrats countered with a $450,000 threshold.  On the estate tax, Republicans are still asking for 35 percent taxes on estates of $5.12 million. Democrats want a 45 percent tax rate on estates of $3.5 million. The Republican plan would continue current policies; several Democratic senators prefer that approach.  Frustration, Intransigence  Members of both parties expressed frustration -- and blamed the other partys intransigence.  Weve known about this for two years, said Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican. This is a total dereliction of duty at every level.  Nelson of Nebraska blamed special interests, partisanship and ideological extremism that have crowded out centrist lawmakers.  America is very functional, but Washington has become dysfunctional, he said.  Bipartisan deficit-reduction talks have been occurring in Washington for more than two years. A proposal by leaders of Obamas fiscal commission, led by Republican Alan Simpson and Democrat Erskine Bowles, didnt have enough support to advance to votes in Congress.  Deadlocked Supercommittee  The debt-ceiling negotiations in 2011 yielded spending cuts, some up front and some set for 2013. They also set up a congressional supercommittee, which deadlocked.  In 2012, the House passed bills extending the tax cuts and delaying the spending cuts.  Lawmakers didnt start cross-party talks until after the Nov. 6 election, when it became clear that Obama, the Republican-majority House and the Democratic-led Senate would have another two years staring across the table at each other.  The task of reaching a compromise fell to the Senate after earlier efforts by Obama and Boehner to make a deal collapsed.  Two weeks before the deadline, Obama and Boehner were edging toward a deal to include $1 trillion each in tax increases and spending cuts and Obama was willing to accept an inflation yardstick reducing Social Security cost-of-living increases.  Boehner, who faces a speakership election by the new Congress that convenes Jan. 3, backed away. He proposed an alternative, Plan B, to allow higher tax rates for annual income exceeding $1 million, and then scrapped the vote when it appeared his caucus wouldnt support the tax increases.  Increasingly Polarized  Senator Richard Lugar, an Indiana Republican who is retiring after losing a primary election, said members in both parties have increasingly become polarized by primary election threats and it was impeding deal-making for the greater good.  Senator Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, said the problem was more pronounced in the House than the Senate -- and said Boehner has been unwilling to use his power to bend House Republicans to his will.  There are 50 hard-right people in the House who dont want to compromise, Schumer said on ABCs This Week. I am hopeful in the new year, after Speaker Boehner is re-elected and he doesnt have to worry about those 50, that he will start working in a way like the Senate works a little more, which is Democrats and Republicans together, a majority of each party deciding and the extreme not deciding.  Boehners Leverage  Boehner has been listening to his members, and that wont change after hes re-elected as speaker, said Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist and former aide to former House Speaker Dennis Hastert of  Illinois .  Boehner and his Republican conference will have leverage over the Democrats on raising the debt ceiling, Bonjean said. You will see the first quarter of the year being dominated by spending cuts and entitlement reform as a permission slip for the Democrats to raise the debt ceiling.  That suggests more roadblocks for Obamas agenda even after his decisive re-election in November.  Immigration is going to be a very tough issue for Republicans to tackle, Bonjean said. Coming off a very bruising fiscal cliff fight, pivoting to immigration is going to be more troublesome for Republicans to coalesce around the plan.  Obamas re-election doesnt mean he should get everything he wants yet it certainly means that everything he reasonably proposes should get a fair hearing, said Representative Rob Andrews, a New Jersey Democrat.

Royal Bank, Canadas largest lender, forecast C$23 billionin sales by non-financial corporations, as much as C$10 billionin securitizations, about C$6 billion in high-yield debt and C$5billion in issuance from companies outside Canada.  Low Rates  Issuance surged to a record this year in Bloomberg figuresdating back to 1999, as companies looking to lock in lowborrowing costs found investors seeking to improve on governmentbond returns. These conditions will likely continue, with thecentral bank holding rates steady at 1 percent until the finalquarter of 2013, according to the median forecast in a BloombergNews survey of 23 economists.  I expect a robust new issuance calendar in 2013, Susan Rimmer, head of corporate and financial debt capital markets atCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said in an interview inToronto . We witnessed record new issues in 2012 and I wouldexpect in 2013 the same kind of conditions are going topersist.  Provincial Bonds  Elsewhere in credit markets, the extra yield investorsdemand to own the debt of Canadian investment-grade corporationsrather than the federal government fell one basis point to 135basis points last week, or 1.35 percentage point, according toBank of America Merrill Lynch data. The spread between corporateand federal government debt has narrowed 48 basis points thisyear. Corporate bonds have returned 6.55 percent percent thisyear.  In the provincial  bond market , spreads widened one basispoint to 74 basis points last week from the week before, andwidened four basis points this year. Provincial bonds havereturned 3.31 percent in 2012, while federal  government bonds returned 2.34 percent.  Canadas benchmark 10-year bonds fell, pushing the yield up4 basis points to 1.1 percent at 10:02 a.m. in Toronto. The 2.75percent security maturing in June 2022 declined 34 cents toC$108.17.  Equity volatility has risen on concern U.S. lawmakers willfail to reach a deficit reduction deal in time to avoid taxincreases and spending cuts set to take effect tomorrow. TheChicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as theVIX, reached its highest level since November 2011 last weekrelative to the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month  Volatility Index , datacompiled by Bloomberg show.  GDP Growth  Canadas gross domestic product grew 0.1 percent in Octoberafter stalling in September and shrinking 0.1 percent in August, Statistics Canada  said on Dec. 21. The economy will  slow to a1.8 percent rate of growth in 2013, from 2 percent this year and2.6 percent in 2011, according to the median estimate of 29analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. That would be the slowest annualpace since the recession of 2009. The U.S. consumes about threequarters of Canadas exports.  If the U.S. avoids recession, corporate issuance next yearmay surpass RBCs C$96 billion projection, which was based ona very cautious scenario, said Altaf Nanji, senior credit-research analyst at  RBC Capital Markets .  Theres a lot of torque in the system, Toronto-basedNanji said in a telephone interview. If you can alleviate someof the roadblocks it really could take off.  Telecommunications operators may turn to debt markets tofinance bids in wireless  spectrum auctions  the government plansto hold in the first part of next year, Nanji said, predictingthe companies will issue C$2.5 to C$3 billion in 2013.  Pipeline Approvals  Another boost to issuance next year may come if pipelineprojects such as TransCanada Corp.s Keystone XL project, whichis under U.S. government review, gets approved, according toDarcy Briggs at Franklin Templeton Investments Corp.s BissettInvestment Management.  Should some pipeline capacity be approved then a numberof pipeline projects that are on hold currently could needfunding, which would mean increased issuance, said Briggs, aCalgary-based money manager whose firm oversees C$4.3 billion infixed-income assets.  Appetite for lower-rated deals may sharpen on any signs ofimprovement in the global economy as risk appetite improves.  Within the investment grade corporate bond market weexpect to see a gradual movement down into the triple-Bcategory, from the A and AA category, in part from the searchfor yield,  Robert Follis , a credit analyst at Scotiabank saidin a phone interview from Toronto. He expects issuance to fallnext year as investors opt for stocks.  High Yield  However Paul Tepsich, who manages the C$62.8 millionAdvantaged Canadian High-Yield Bond Fund for the Bank of  NovaScotia  at High Rock Capital, predicts the growing number ofretirees in Canada will help drive Canadian debt issuance to newrecords in the coming years as investors seek yield morereliable than stock dividends, he said.  The growing appetite for yield will particularly favorspeculative-grade bonds, said Tepsich. Companies sold a recordC$4.4 billion of Canadian-dollar high-yield debt this year, 52percent more than in 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Canadian  junk bonds  returned 16 percent this year,including reinvested interest, and investment-grade corporatebonds gained 6.5 percent. That beat stocks on the TSX, whichmade investors 6.1 percent with dividends reinvested.  The one thing in  capital markets  in  North America  thatwont change is the baby-boomers are hitting 60, Tepsich said.In a low-interest rate environment, which I think were goingto see for more than three years, well continue to see themkind of grind towards true yield as opposed to equity-baseddividend yield.

He reduced the risk of the single currencybreaking up and put in place a potential mechanism for dealingwith the debt crisis.  Financial Debt  The cost of insuring financial debt is heading for thebiggest-ever annual decline and earlier this month traded at thelowest levels since May 2011. The Markit iTraxx Financial Indexlinked to senior debt of 25 banks and insurers was littlechanged today at 143 basis points after falling from 279 at thestart of the year.

Reassured by the central bank backstop, corporatetreasurers seized on record-low borrowing costs by issuingalmost 294 billion euros of debt this year, the most since 2009when a record 383.5 billion euros of non-financial securities ineuros and pounds were issued, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Bond yields plunged to a record 1.91 percent on averagefrom 4.4 percent at the start of the year, Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynchs Euro Corporate Index shows.  Volkswagen Bonds  Volkswagen AG, Europes biggest carmaker, and utilityElectricite de France SA led issuance, with VW pricing eightbenchmark-sized euro-denominated bonds in the second half of theyear, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  While company debt investors earned 13 percent on theirholdings this year, according to Bank of America Merrill LynchsEuro Corporate Index, pickings are forecast to be slimmer nextyear as sales slow.

Buyers demand 72 basis points more than interbankrates to buy senior notes backed by U.K. prime residentialmortgages, approaching the lowest since January 2008, and a dropfrom 165 basis points a year earlier, according to JPMorganChase & Co. data.  Covered Bonds  Sales of covered bonds from European banks dropped to about198 billion euros from 294 billion euros a year ago, accordingto JPMorgan.

Yet agriculture hasbeen around for just 11,000 years, and the first stategovernment arose only 5,400 years ago.  In other words, life as we know it accounts for a smallfraction of human history. By looking closely at the worldslast few traditional (i.e., tribal) societies -- especially inNew Guinea, where hes spent much of the past half-century --Diamond shows what it must have been like before that.  He deftly explodes a few myths, beginning with Jean-JacquesRousseaus speculative and ungrounded theory that humans werenaturally compassionate in a state of nature, and that warsbegan only with the rise of states.  The reality was the opposite -- maniacal xenophobia andperennial war. If you encountered a stranger on your path, youhad essentially two options: run or fight.  The percentage of people that tribal societies typicallylost in conflicts dwarfs German and Russian war losses duringthe 20th century (even if the numbers seem less dramatic atfirst because they arent in the millions).  Thats why theyve so often accepted state control with solittle protest: Since states, for their own reasons, suppresstribal warfare, life under their authority is less dangerous anda lot more pleasant.  Lessons Learned  The World Until Yesterday is packed with fascinatinginformation of this kind. But because Diamond has constructed itas a series of lessons we can learn from what once were calledprimitive peoples, its also problematic.  I dont doubt his good faith when he declares, My ownoutlook on life has been transformed and enriched by my yearsamong one set of traditional societies, that of New Guinea. (Hepreviously wrote about these societies, among others, in hisPulitzer Prize-winning book,  Guns, Germs and Steel .)  But then what does he tell us we can learn from them? Tovalue mediation as a method of settling legal disputes. To treatthe elderly with greater dignity. To watch our salt and sugarintake.  Fifty years of study -- for that?  Diamonds most intriguing discussion, in terms of novel andusable information, involves child rearing. I was happy to findhim advocating, for example, that parents allow small childrento share their beds; Im still mad about how strictly my ownparents barred me from theirs.  Too Obvious  But even when Diamond offers convincing arguments aboutthe precocious development of social skills in the children ofhunter-gatherers, he dulls them with an irritating habit ofbelaboring the hyper-obvious:  Naturally, Im not saying that we should emulate allchild-rearing practices of hunter-gatherers. I dont recommendthat we return to the hunter-gatherer practices of selectiveinfanticide, high risk of death in childbirth and lettinginfants play with knives and get burned by fires.  Or, on the elderly: I dont know any individual Americanwhose devoted care of his aged parents goes as far as pre-chewing their food, nor any who has strangled his aged parentsand been publicly commended as a good son for doing so.  Much like his friends in the New Guinea jungle, for whomthere is no time pressure, no schedule, Diamond is in no hurryto get where hes going.  What disturbs me more than the leisurely blandness of hisstyle, though, is his apparent conviction (or maybe it came fromhis agent or his publisher) that he had to make his bookrelevant by delivering news you can use. The idea that knowledgeisnt sufficient in itself is depressing if not insulting.  I was absorbed as I read The World Before Yesterday.But faced with the embarrassing question its subtitle poses --What Can We Learn From Traditional Societies? -- I would haveto answer: Not all that much.

Barden at  barden@bloomberg.net "}, {"title": "The Asian Innovation Century, Again", "date": "2012-12-31", "time": "13:00:09", "content": "Over the last three years I have consistently stated my belief that Asia was emerging as a global innovation powerhouse. It's one of the primary reasons why I moved to Singapore in early 2010. In late 2011, I even  wrote , \"The overarching trend I continue to see is a shift in the world's innovation energy to the east.\" While my long-term optimism remains, I think the region must overcome some very real hurdles before it can realize its potential. Some of these, like creaky infrastructure and a lack of a fully functioning risk-capital market, are straightforward and don't require further detailing. More pernicious and harder to address are three critical mindset shifts that need to happen. First, there needs to be  substantially higher tolerance for failure . The lack of failure tolerance can be rooted in laws \u2014 long-lasting penalties for bankruptcies lead people to avoid risk. But it also can be from pressure from peers, family, friends, and co-workers. It can set early when children are in school. Innovation isn't random, but it isn't perfectly predictable either. Any success will have its twists, turns, and false starts. Some of history's most world-changing ideas were in fact accidental discoveries. A fear of failure can choke off innovation. Second,  hierarchical decision-making approaches need to shift to approaches that favor good ideas wherever they might come from . I remember vividly one experience at a large Asian company. We were working with a young middle manager that was developing a business plan for a new idea. It was quickly clear the idea stunk, and the middle manager knew it. I said, \"If we all know this is a dog, why are we working on it?\" The unsurprising answer was, \"The boss likes it.\" The argument that the boss would ultimately be happier to not waste time on an idea that was destined to flop fell on deaf ears. Innovation can't be a largest-title-wins game; it has to be a legitimately best-idea wins. Senior leaders with wisdom and institutional knowledge can certainly spark great ideas, but so too can 20-somethings that lack preconceived notions and are living tomorrow today.  Third,  companies, particularly large ones, need a dose of humility . Many executives in Asia are appropriately proud of their role in building world-class companies in relatively short periods of time. That success has come from discipline and focused execution. Unfortunately, those skills are less helpful in guiding innovation or leading a company through transformation. Some organizations display deep humility. For example, many executives in the Singapore Government have a deep curiosity, honed by spending time living overseas. They are always on the lookout for a good idea, wherever it might be. Other organizations, however, that lack appropriate humility will find the fall from greatness surprisingly swift and punishing. These mindsets won't change overnight. Focused work by policymakers and corporate leaders in three areas can help:  Asia is as far from a monolith as you'll find in the world. Its people, cultures, heritages, religions, and customs are breathtakingly diverse. Imagine this diversity replicated in the business world. With the right mindset shifts, the vast well of innovation potential still lying dormant in Asia has the potential to change the world"}, {"title": "Egypt Activist Critically Wounded in Drive-by Shooting in Tahrir", "date": "2012-12-31", "time": "15:26:41", "content": "Unidentified gunmen opened fire onprotesters in Cairos  Tahrir Square  today, wounding two people,including one said to be the sole witness in the killing ofanother activist last year.

As President  Barack Obama  told RussianPresident  Dmitry Medvedev  last March before an unanticipatedopen microphone, This is my last election. After my election Ihave more flexibility.  We can think of many places more deserving of presidentialflexibility than  Russia , which is in such a state of pugnaciousisolationism that it will simply pocket any concessions.Instead, Bloomberg View has put together a list of foreignpolicy challenges that merit the spending of political capitalin 2013. Instead of focusing on worthy perennials -- ratifyingthe Law of the Sea Treaty, or rediscovering  Latin America  (aspresidential candidate  Mitt Romney  astutely suggested) -- wevetried to find areas where a sharp course correction is essentialand might pay big dividends.  -- Let 2013 be the year that the U.S. starts taking  NorthKorea  seriously. A U.S. policy predicated on getting the NorthKoreans to give up their nuclear weapons before trying toresolve larger issues -- beginning with a peace treaty for theKorean peninsula, which is still technically at war -- is anonstarter. Kim Jong Un may not be the  sexiest man alive , buthes not crazy.  -- The administration needs to abandon its reticence about repression  in Bahrain, where a ban on demonstrations in Octobershowed a  retreat  from once-promised reforms. The U.S. shouldreimpose the cutoff of arms sales to Bahrain that it lifted inMay. It should also pursue a  report  suggesting that Bahrainviolated its Fair Trade Agreement with the U.S. by firing 2,700people who participated in 2011 pro-democracy strikes. The U.S.belongs on the side of the Arab Spring, not the Arab Winter.  -- In Syria, the administration should get off thesidelines and work to consolidate the opposition to the regimeof Bashar al-Assad; fund, equip and train rebel forces that signup to a nonsectarian agenda; and renew efforts to persuade the United Nations Security Council  to take action.  -- On Iran, the U.S. should continue to lead the globalsanctions effort. Yet it should simultaneously reopen the doorto a deal under which Iran complies with  International AtomicEnergy Agency  demands on monitoring, access and information, andhalts nuclear fuel production -- with the exception of enrichinguranium to the maximum 3.5 percent level that is required tofuel civilian power stations, a level of enrichment thats a redline for Iran. A fully monitored Iranian low-enrichment programentails risks and may not satisfy the government in  Israel . Butit has as good a chance of blocking Iran from acquiring anuclear weapon as airstrikes, with fewer risks and unintendedconsequences.  -- We learned after the presidential election that theObama administration, planning for a potential loss, had been codifying  the U.S. approach to killing terrorists with unmanneddrones. Lets hope electoral victory hasnt stemmed progress.Obama pushed the drone war into overdrive four years ago, andmore than 2,500 people have been killed in about 300 strikes,mostly in  Afghanistan  and Yemen. Going ahead, we need clearrules on whether the 2001 authorization of the use of force inAfghanistan is a legitimate legal basis for killings takingplace 12 years later and as far away as North Africa; how namesare added to the kill list; whether the Central IntelligenceAgency or military should run the program, whether Americancitizens such as Anwar al-Awlaki have greater legal protectionsthan noncitizen targets; and what the criteria should be fordeciding on a strike as opposed to capturing the terrorist.  -- In its zeal to prevent another global financial crisis,the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has drafted rules tomake the  derivatives market  more transparent. Problem is, theCFTC has moved much more quickly than its global counterpartsand risks fomenting regulatory  arbitrage , in which it pushestrading away from U.S. markets to countries with more opaquerules. The U.S. needs to work with global regulators on rulesthat will be comparable enough to prevent market participantsfrom exploiting regulatory gaps.  -- Will the legalization of marijuana by Colorado andWashington force a truce in the U.S. war on drugs? Mexicans andCentral Americans, tens of thousands of whom have died in thecrossfire, can only hope so. Legalization is actually better forMexico than creeping decriminalization, which expands the U.S.market for Mexican drugs instead of supplanting it. If the U.S.lets the state laws stand, the larger challenge will be ensuringcontinued cooperation in the fight against more dangerous drugssuch as heroin and cocaine. The U.S. can advance that cause byde-emphasizing shiny helicopters and special drug squads infavor of support for judicial and legal reforms to fightcorruption. It can also get rid of the certificationcharade, which conditions U.S. assistance to countries on theirwillingness to help it with its drug-demand problem.  -- We hope that the 51st year of the U.S. embargo againstCuba will be its last. Obama eased some restrictions in hisfirst term -- and he won half the Cuban-American vote inNovember. He can now encourage free-market advocates in Cuba bylifting sanctions that even most Cuban-Americans dont thinkserve any purpose -- the sooner the better, given the flood ofCuban emigres that new travel freedoms may begin to unleash thismonth.  -- The U.S. will pursue trade deals such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an agreement among 11 nations in  Asia  andthe Americas, along with a possible deal to eliminate barrierswith the European Union. Yet such discrete growth-boostingagreements shouldnt be achieved at the expense of U.S.engagement with the  World Trade Organization , which still offersthe best framework for easing trade disputes and creating aglobal system of rules. The first step would be to lead the restof the world back to negotiations that ended in 2011, after thecollapse of the Doha Development Agenda in a dispute between Brazil ,  India  and  South Africa  on one side, and the U.S. andWestern Europe on the other.  -- Earlier in his presidency, Obama rightly calculated thatinvestments in Israeli-Palestinian peace-making would bring fewreturns, but disengagement has become a  dangerous policy  asPalestinian supporters of negotiations are  losing the argument to militants. To bolster  Mahmoud Abbas , the relatively moderatechairman of the strapped  Palestinian Authority , the U.S. shouldpress Israel to stop withholding  tax revenue  it collects onbehalf of the authority and to cease its aggressive expansion ofJewish settlements in the West Bank.

Evenso, it takes a lot to dislodge those beliefs. When we areconfronted by contrary evidence, we may dig in even more deeply.Consider a cautionary tale, exotic to be sure, but helping toexplain why evidence-challenged thinking persists in a lot ofareas, including politics and business.  Harold Camping , a Christian radio talk-show host, predictedthat the world was going to end on May 21, 2011, with the comingof the rapture. He contended that the Earth would be ravaged,that all human beings would be judged, and that believers wouldascend to heaven. He said that those who werent saved wouldexperience five months of hell on earth until the annihilationof creation on Oct. 21, 2011.  Campings program could be heard daily on his network, Family Radio , one of the largest Christian broadcasting networksin the U.S., which benefited from a budget of tens of millionsof dollars. His prediction was followed by millions of peoplearound the world, and a lot of them seemed to believe it.  But did they, really? Social scientists have offered twodifferent hypotheses about those who appear to hold extremebeliefs.  The first is that they are entirely sincere. They areinfluenced by figures of authority and also by trusted peers.When they express a belief that the world is ending -- or anyother extreme belief that is essentially a matter of faith --they mean it.  Sincere Belief  The second hypothesis is that people who purport to acceptextreme beliefs often lack conviction and are responding tosocial pressures. If you could somehow get them in private, youwould find a lot more skepticism, uncertainty and doubt.  It isnt easy to test the competing hypotheses. Economist Ned Augenblick  of the  University of California  at Berkeley andhis co-authors have now provided such a test. At least forCampings followers, the answer is unambiguous: Their belief wasentirely sincere.  Heres how the test went. Four weeks before May 21, 2011,Augenblick and his co-authors  asked  a number of Campingsfollowers: Would you prefer to have $5 today or some greateramount of money after May 21? That greater amount ranged up to$500. The researchers posed exactly the same questions tomembers of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, who also believethat Judgment Day is coming, but not by a specified date.  The median cutoff answer from  the Seventh-day Adventists was $7 -- well within the range of answers given by most people.By contrast, the median cutoff answer from Family Radio memberswas $500, meaning that they would prefer $5 now to $500 on May22. As far as the researchers could tell with the payments theyoffered, there was no amount that Family Radio members wouldprefer on May 22 to $5 today -- compelling evidence that theysincerely believed that the rapture was coming on May 21.  We know, of course, that the rapture didnt come on thatday. Did Family Radio members conclude that the whole idea was afraud? Not at all.  Camping himself quickly  recovered , insisting that hehad been correct, but that the world wasnt ending for a while,because of a divine decision to delay implementation: On May 21Christ did come spiritually to put all of the unsaved throughoutthe world into judgment. But that universal judgment will not bephysically seen until the last day of the five month judgmentperiod, on October 21, 2011.  This kind of fancy footwork is characteristic of leadersand followers, who often respond by doubling down in theaftermath of false apocalyptic  prophecies .  Contrary Evidence  For decades, social psychologists have invoked findings ofthis sort to support the idea that people seek to avoidcognitive dissonance by dismissing evidence that isinconsistent with their deepest beliefs. When people aresincerely committed to the truth of some proposition, they willwork hard to hold on to it, even if the facts stand in their way.  Our desire to maintain our deepest convictions may be sointense that contrary evidence doesnt merely fail to underminethose convictions; on the contrary, and bizarrely, it mayfortify them. For example, researchers have  found  that afterhearing about apparently credible evidence to the contrary, manypeople who believed that  Iraq  had weapons of mass destructionended up thinking the same thing they thought before -- onlymore strongly.  The good news is that in the face of clear contradictoryevidence, people eventually find it hard to maintain falsebeliefs. In May 2012, Camping asked for forgiveness for hismistaken prediction about Judgment Day. God has humbled usthrough the events of May 21, he wrote. We must also openlyacknowledge that we have no new evidence pointing to anotherdate for the end of the world.  (Cass R.

The exhibition of his work at the National Gallery, London,had the public standing in line from before dawn for tickets.  In Paris, later in the spring, another show built aroundthe cleaned Virgin and Child With St. Anne was equallythronged. This contained a recently identified contemporaryversion of the  Mona Lisa , which historians said was probablyproduced in the masters studio in parallel with the original.  Leonardos year ended on a lower note. Earlier, there werealso indications that some remnants of his lost Battle ofAnghiari may exist behind a wall in the Palazzo Vecchio,Florence,  Italy . However, the search to find it was put on holdin September.  This month, it was announced the Museum of Art,  Dallas , hadfailed to agree a price for the  Salvator Mundi  -- a paintingnewly attributed to him and included in the National Galleryexhibition. If Dallas cant afford a Leonardo, one might wonder,who can?  On the other hand, maybe Texas is better off without it.Though I agree it is an authentic Leonardo, it is an odd and notvery attractive work.  Among younger artists, 75-year-old  David Hockney  enjoyed aspectacular twelve months, beginning in January with A BiggerPicture, an array of paintings and drawings mainly done withinthe previous few years, and only shortly before the opening.  The show attracted more than 600,000 visitors in a shorttwo-and-a-half-month run at the  Royal Academy .  Getting Better  They would probably still have been lining up downPiccadilly, if the exhibition had not had to move on to Bilbao, Spain . Its now at the Museum Ludwig, Cologne,  Germany  (untilFeb 3, 2013). At each venue it has looked different, and incertain ways better.  The Cologne version has the best installation of Hockneys3, 9 and 18 camera films, including an astonishing room withmoving, synchronized, multi-image films of the same road atdifferent times of year, one season to each wall.  Hockney didnt receive a unanimously positive reaction fromcritics. I suspect that was because in painting and drawing thelandscape he has been doing something that contemporary artistsarent supposed to do. The art world is quite a conformistplace, though it likes to think it loves transgression.  Another celebrated British artist with the initials D.H.had a big, museum show in Olympic year.   Damien Hirst  at Tate Modern was also popular in termsof attendance: 463,087 visitors in a five-month run.  Plastic Skulls  It broke another kind of record, with some of the mostexpensive items ever marketed in an exhibition shop, includingan edition of painted plastic skulls at 36,800 pounds ($59,388)each and a set of plates at 10,500 pounds.  The visitors were not wrong to flock to Tate Modern,because this was a good representation of Hirsts work. Closeexamination of the labels, however, revealed some lessflattering figures.  A surprising proportion of the works on show, and almostall the best, were two decades old or more. In an artist who is47 years old, this was not an encouraging sign.  A startlingly lackluster show of new  oil paintings  at  WhiteCube  in Londons Bermondsey tended to confirm that Hirst,temporarily or permanently, has run out of new ideas. That isntgood for someone who is, at least partly a conceptual artist.His work may well not last as well as Leonardos has when hesnot 47, but 560 years old.

I would hope that as soon as is humanly possible, a decision will be made to allow us to take action on the extension, Lucas told reporters off the House floor. We need to take positive action, put this issue to rest, and make sure that it is clear to everybody in this country that the farm bill policy has certainty and that we will not have $8 or $9 milk.  The draft bill would extend current law, along with disaster aid for producers affected by this years U.S. drought and changes to current milk policy, through Sept. 30. It would reduce mandatory outlays by $30 million through fiscal 2022, according to the  Congressional Budget Office . The bulk of the spending would come in the first year, and as such it would actually increase spending by an estimated $555 million through fiscal 2017.  Other Bills  The proposal is one of three farm-related draft bills released over the weekend in the  House of Representatives ; all of them would stave off the potential jump in consumer milk prices should government commodity programs begin to lapse tomorrow.  The second measure would extend most of the current law through Jan. 31, and the third would protect only against possible dairy-price spikes. Those two are opposed by House and Senate Democratic agriculture leaders. Representative  Collin Peterson  of  Minnesota , the top Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee, called a 30-day extension a poor joke on farmers that offers no certainty.  The most recent farm law, enacted in 2008, expired after attempts to pass a new five-year proposal failed. Without that plan, agricultural programs automatically return to rules passed in 1949, the basis of all subsequent legislation.  The effects of that transition have been delayed because of the growing seasons of different crops. Dairy production, a year-round business, is the first major commodity affected. In November, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  put the price of a gallon of fresh whole  milk  at just under $3.54.  Parity Price  Under President Harry S. Trumans farm policy, the government bought supplies of a product until its price reached parity with the cost immediately before World War I. Adjusted for a century of inflation, the Agriculture Departments milk-support price today would be $39.08 per hundred pounds, more than double the dairy futures price of $18.60 at 8:34 a.m. in  New York  today.  Under the revised dairy plan, written by Peterson, the government would manage the milk supply by setting milk- production limits for farmers who enroll in a market- stabilization program. The proposal eliminates programs that pay farmers when prices fall below a certain level, replacing them with initiatives designed to protect profit margins through insurance programs and by limiting output, which would raise prices.  Milk Oversupply  Oversupply of milk that drives down prices has been a perpetual difficulty for dairy producers. The National Milk Producers Federation, an organization of farmers and dairy cooperatives, has supported the plan, while the International Dairy Foods Association, which represents milk processors such as Dallas-based  Dean Foods Co. (DF) , has opposed it for potentially driving up the cost of their raw materials.  The market-stabilization plan was included in both the Senates 10-year, $1 trillion version of the farm bill it passed in June and a bill approved in July by the House Agriculture Committee but not taken up by the full chamber. It wasnt in the 2008 farm law, which the one-year draft legislation would extend -- adding the new dairy program. House Speaker  John Boehner , an  Ohio Republican , has called the current dairy program Soviet- style management of the farm economy that the Peterson plan would worsen.  The dairy language remains a sticking point, according to several Republicans, including Representative  Fred Upton  of  Michigan . They said Republican leaders have yet to decide whether to try to incorporate Petersons preferred dairy language -- a change that would be key to winning support from the Democrats who have been following Petersons lead on this bill.  Were going to let the House work its will, said Upton, who predicted that were going to be looking at a straight extension of the farm bill for the next nine months.  Milk-Price Ripple  Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack yesterday warned that without a new farm bill, consumers will pay the price.  Consumers, when they go in the grocery store, are going to be a bit shocked when instead of seeing $3.60 for milk, they see $7 a gallon for milk, he said on CNNs  State of the Union  program. Thats going to ripple throughout all of the commodities if this thing goes on for an extended period of time.  Lawmakers are considering a farm package as part of a resolution to the larger budget dispute involving more than $600 billion in tax increases and spending cuts set to take effect Jan. 1.  Several  House Republicans  said that if an agreement is reached to deal with the larger tax and spending issues, the Senate could attach a one-year extension of the law, which funds food aid to poor families as well as subsidies to growers of corn, cotton and other crops.  Were mostly waiting for the Senate to see what they put together, said Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington state, the fourth-ranking Republican in the House.  If the leadership were waiting until the last minute, said Senator  Pat Roberts  of  Kansas , the top Republican on the Senate Agriculture Committee, were sure as hell there.

Neither chamber has voted on the plan, or on narroweralternatives, with both houses set to resume work today. Still,should Congress fail to deal with milk costs that may doublewithout action, price increases may be slowed while the USDAseeks to turn back time, analyst Dave Kurzawski said.  Everyone wont start selling their butter and cheese tothe U.S. government on Jan. 2, Kurzawski, a consultant at INTLFCStone Inc. in  Chicago , said in an interview. We are going toneed to find a resolution to this, though.  The most recent farm law, passed in 2008, expired Sept. 30.Without a replacement, agricultural programs return to earlierrules that are the basis of all subsequent legislation. Theeffects of that transition have been delayed because of thegrowing seasons of different crops. Dairy, a year-roundbusiness, is the first major commodity affected. In November,the USDA estimated the price of a gallon of fresh whole  milk  atjust under $3.54.  Draft Bill  The  draft bill  agreed upon by the farm-panel leaders wouldextend the expired farm law through Sept. 30, provide disasteraid for producers affected by this years drought, and makechanges to milk policy. The new dairy program would managesupply partly by setting production limits for farmers whoenroll in a market-stabilization program.  House Speaker  John Boehner , an  Ohio Republican , has opposedthat concept, calling it worse than current policies that hetermed Soviet-style. The proposal wasnt on a list ofmeasures released last night to be considered by the Houseduring todays session.  President Harry S. Trumans farm policy from 1949 requiredthe government to buy supplies of a product until its priceapproached parity with the cost immediately before World WarI. Adjusted for a century of inflation, the USDA milk-supportprice today would be $39 per hundred pounds, more than doublethe dairy futures price in Chicago today.  Price Supports  This price-support policy, which once brought rivers ofdumped milk and  free cheese  for the poor, was graduallyabandoned as U.S. agriculture law became more market oriented.  Massive government purchases would dramatically increase government spending , would force consumers to pay significantlymore for dairy products, and would impose long-term damage tothe  dairy industry , the Washington-based International DairyFoods Association wrote in  a letter  to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack last week.  The group, which represents  Kroger Co. (KR) , the largest U.S.grocery chain, and  Nestle SA (NESN) , the worlds biggest food company,urged the USDA to proceed in a thoughtful and deliberatemanner in any move to implement the 1949 law. It said today itopposes the dairy plan included in the proposed farm-billextension for potentially limiting the supply of milk byencouraging farmers to cap production.  Ironic Threat  It is ironic that the threat of higher dairy prices forconsumers, caused by the possible implementation of the 1949Act, is being used to force Congress to pass a new program thatwill result in higher prices, Jerry Slominski, the groupssenior vice-president for legislative and economic affairs, saidin a statement.  The National Milk Producers Federation, an organization offarmers and dairy cooperatives, has supported the supply-management concept.  Vilsack hasnt offered specifics as to how the USDA wouldintervene in milk markets, while warning consumers that inactionon a new farm bill will have far-reaching consequences.  Consumers, when they go in the grocery store, are goingto be a bit shocked when instead of seeing $3.60 a gallon formilk, they see $7 a gallon, he said yesterday on  CNN s  Stateof the Union  broadcast. Thats going to ripple throughoutall of the commodities if this thing goes on for an extendedperiod of time.  Bill Plans  Should Congress not reach a deal on either a separateextension of agriculture legislation or its inclusion in a planto avert the so-called fiscal cliff of tax increases andspending cuts that are set to take effect tomorrow, a new farmlaw may be delayed until at least March.  The House Agriculture Committee plans to start drafting newlegislation on Feb. 27. Its Senate counterpart will debate a newbill soon, should an extension fail, Chairwoman  Debbie Stabenow , a Michigan Democrat, said yesterday. The Senate passeda five-year plan in June, followed by the House farm panel inJuly. The full House never voted on a plan. The Congress thatconvenes Jan. 3 must restart work on a farm bill.  In the meantime, implementing 1949 rules would take aconsiderable amount of time, House Agriculture CommitteeChairman  Frank Lucas  said in an e-mail last week. The OklahomaRepublican said Vilsack should follow the federal rulemakingprocess, including a public comment period, before moving ahead.  Delayed Effects  Even if the USDA immediately embraced the 1948 law, theeffects might not reach consumers for weeks, said Mike North, asenior risk-management adviser at  First Capitol Ag  inPlatteville,  Wisconsin . Swift action on rules is unlikely, hesaid.  Government purchases would follow specifications that notall processors could immediately meet, he said in a telephoneinterview. Then, products must be packaged and distributed toretailers. Because the commodity is only about half the totalcost of a dairy product, doubling the price paid to farmers maymake $4 milk only about $6 milk once it reaches theconsumer, he said.  Still, the possibility of higher prices may push up milkfutures, and raising consumer costs, said FCStones Kurzawski.The uncertainty isnt good for the industry, he said.  Farm bills, which Congress usually passes every five years,set policy and fund USDA programs including food stamps and cropsubsidies. They frequently lapse before a new law is passed. Thebill that ended in September took effect on June 18, 2008, morethan nine months after its predecessor expired.  To contact the reporter on this story:Alan Bjerga in Washington at  abjerga@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:Jon Morgan at  jmorgan97@bloomberg.net "}, {"title": "For-Profit Nursing Homes Lead in Overcharging While Care Suffers", "date": "2012-12-31", "time": "13:41:56", "content": "A  report  by federal health care inspectors in November said the U.S. nursing home industry overbills Medicare $1.5 billion a year for treatments patients dont need or never receive.  Not disclosed was how much worse it is when providers have a profit motive. Thirty per cent of claims sampled from for- profit homes were deemed improper, compared to just 12 percent from non-profits, according to data Bloomberg News obtained from the inspector generals office of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services via a Freedom of Information Act request.  The figures add to the case -- advanced by health care researchers and Medicare overseers in at least six government and academic studies in the last three years -- that the rise of for-profit providers is fueling waste, fraud and patient harm in the $2.8 trillion U.S health care sector. At nursing homes, 78 percent of $105 billion in revenues went to for-profits in 2010, up from 72 percent in 2002, according to the latest available government breakdowns.  Research shows for-profits are more likely to pursue money in all kinds of ways than non-profits are, even by pushing the legal envelope, says Jill Horwitz, a professor at the School of Law at the University of  California , Los Angeles, who has written 30 papers on health care.  Federal prosecutors brought 120 now-resolved civil and criminal cases against nursing homes and related individuals from 2008 to 2012, twice the number of the prior five years, said Gary Cantrell, deputy inspector general of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. That compares to a 60 percent rise in all department cases, Cantrell said.  Criminal Charges  At a nursing home in South Carolina owned by  Life Care Centers of America Inc ., an 80-year-old woman who couldnt control her head or keep her eyes open was placed in a standing frame for 84 minutes of physical and occupational therapy just two days before she died -- one in a number of Life Care overcharges for unnecessary care, according to civil fraud allegations filed in November by the U.S. Justice Department in federal court in Chattanooga.  Closely-held Life Care, based in  Cleveland ,  Tennessee , has denied wrongdoing. With over 30,000 beds, its the third-biggest U.S. nursing chain, according to the trade magazine  Provider .  Skilled Healthcare Group Inc. (SKH) , which operates 75 U.S. sites, was charged in state court in October with 11 criminal counts of elder abuse at a nursing home in Eureka, California. The company has said it intends to vigorously defend itself against the charges.  Death Settlements  The company settled six wrongful death lawsuits brought against its homes in Californias Humboldt County between 2005 and 2012 after denying the allegations. Terms werent disclosed.  The incidents alleged in the criminal case occurred at a home in Eureka, one of 22 company sites that were found by a state-court civil jury in 2010 to have skimped on staff to save money. That jury returned a $677 million judgment, which was later reduced to $63 million in a settlement. Patients at the homes were left unattended for hours in soiled clothing, denied meals and baths and suffered infections and malnutrition, according to evidence in the class-action trial.  From nursing homes to walk-in medical clinics, dentistry to dialysis and hospice care, for-profit providers dominate most health care sectors, according to a 2012  report  by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, or Medpac, an arm of the U.S. Congress.  For-Profit Growth  For-profits operate 96 percent of the nations outpatient surgery centers, a sector that has grown by more than a third since 2004, according to Medpac. The number of for-profit hospices grew 10 times faster than non-profits from 2004 through 2009, and now exceed half the U.S. total. For-profits operate 84 percent of home-health care agencies and 85 percent of dialysis clinics for kidney patients.  A notable exception to this trend is hospitals, where nonprofits and government-operated facilities had 88 percent of revenue in 2010, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That has helped non-profit medical providers maintain parity with for- profits in overall health care spending.  Private investment in health care expands choices for patients, spurs innovation and boosts economic output, proponents argue. Nursing homes employ more than 1.6 million workers, second only to hospitals in the health care sector, according to the Alliance for Quality Nursing Home Care, the trade group representing for-profit facilities.  Baby Teeth  For-profit dental management companies, surgery and cancer clinics say they have created competition for traditional hospitals and medical practices and helped patients on Medicaid get more care.  The rising influence of for-profits has led to tensions with doctors, insurers and regulators on several fronts.  Investigators in  Texas ,  Arizona  and California have been examining complaints that dentists linked to dental management companies, a sector backed by at least 25 private equity firms, were responsible for overbilling Medicaid programs for unnecessary treatment, including children receiving unneeded drilling on baby teeth. The companies have said they are expanding care for poor populations and that instances of mistaken work are rare.  Insurer  Aetna Inc. (AET)  is suing surgery centers in California, Texas and New York for alleged price gouging fueled by profit- sharing deals with surgeons who send them patients.  UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH)  has filed a similar California suit. Aetna says one California center charged $53,000 for bunion surgery that normally costs $4,000. The centers have denied the allegations and said the insurers are trying to drive down prices.  Hospice Companies  In the past three years, The U.S. Justice Department has settled civil fraud complaints against eight hospice companies that allegedly enrolled or retained patients who werent dying.  Federal investigators and  Florida s attorney general are looking into similar issues at the nations largest hospice chain,  Chemed Corp. (CHE) s Vitas unit, Chemed said in a regulatory filing in November. Chemed says its discussing the matter with the Florida and federal authorities.  For-profits have eclipsed non-profits in some sectors by zeroing in on services where the government reimbursement rates are high or increasing, Medpac has said.  Wherever youve got government spending huge funds, it incubates growth, said Scott Becker, a Chicago lawyer who publishes  Beckers Hospital Review .  Private equity investors have recently taken aim at hospitals, too, because their size and community roots make them the best politically situated to thrive under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Becker said.  Improper Bills  The 2010 law, a hallmark of President  Barack Obama s first term, encourages health providers to form accountable care organizations that combine doctor practices with hospital groups, which could add to their pricing power.  Private equity investors completed more than 450 hospital transactions in the past decade valued at nearly $50 billion, according to Pitchbook Data, a Seattle-based market research firm. Major hospital buyouts include Cerberus Capitals $830 million acquisition of Caritas Christis six hospitals in  Massachusetts  in 2010, and Blackstone Groups $1.3 billion purchase of Detroit Medical Center the same year.  The November study that found $1.5 billion in improper nursing-home bills -- equivalent to about 5 percent of total Medicare outlays to the facilities -- was by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services office of inspector general. It followed a 2010 OIG  report  that found for-profit nursing homes were nearly twice as likely as nonprofits to bill Medicare at the highest rate for patients of similar ages and diagnoses.  Profit Margins  Investor-owned facilities earn a 20 percent profit margin on Medicare patients compared to 9 percent for nonprofit operators, according to Medpac. Medicare pays nursing homes about a third of their revenues, while Medicaid, the state- federal health insurance program for the poor, accounts for roughly 50 percent. The bulk of the rest is from private payers.  The 10 largest for-profit nursing-home chains employed 37 percent fewer registered nurses per patient-day between 2003 and 2008 -- and received 59 percent more deficiency notices from government inspectors -- than nonprofits did, according to a  study  published last year in the journal Health Services Research. The study was led by  Charlene Harrington , a University of California, San Francisco, professor who has been an expert witness in cases against nursing homes, and testified for the plaintiffs in the civil suit against  Skilled Healthcare . Harrington said she received a $3,000 research grant from a labor union in 2003, though no union funding for the 2011 study.  Greg Crist, spokesman for American Health Care Association, which represents 9,500 nursing homes, said for-profits have improved their patient care in recent years by increasing the ratio of nurses who are registered and winning higher ratings in Medicares rating system for overall quality since 2009.  Quality Initiatives  Quality is something that means a lot to our sector, Crist said. We launched more quality initiatives in 2012. Were not resting.  In a civil complaint unsealed last month, U.S. prosecutors accused Life Care of billing Medicare for unnecessary and sometimes harmful treatments at its 230 nursing homes between 2006 and 2012. It was at the chains Columbia, South Carolina, facility where the woman near death was allegedly braced upright for physical therapy in 2006, according to the complaint.  Therapists billed over two hours of physical, occupational and speech therapy for a 92-year-old patient with lung cancer on the same day he spat up blood at Life Cares Orlando, Florida, facility, the suit alleges. He died two days later. Because Life Care billed for such lengthy sessions, it was able to charge Medicare at the top rate of more than $500 a day for the therapies, the Justice Department says in its lawsuit.  Clinically Inappropriate  The entire rehabilitation staff at Life Cares Estero, Florida, home told their boss in 2007 that we have been encouraged to maximize reimbursement even when clinically inappropriate, according to the U.S. suit. Forrest Preston, the companys chairman, founder and owner, forbade his compliance officers from visiting facilities unannounced, the suit alleges.  Life Care strongly disagrees with the allegations and will vigorously defend its therapy program, according to its website. The company saves the government money by helping patients improve quickly so they spend fewer days in nursing homes, its online statement says. Beecher Hunter, a Life Care spokesman, declined to comment.  When Ruby Gene Papania, 77, was admitted to Skilled Healthcares Granada nursing home in Eureka in September 2010, nurses noted in her chart that she had a high risk of falls and needed extra assistance moving around, according to a lawsuit filed by Papanias daughters last year.  Bed Sores  Papanias care plan said transfers from bed and to the toilet required two staff members as a precaution, or the use of a mechanical lift, the suit said.  Before her death seven months later, Papania fell three times, broke and re-broke her hip, underwent two hip surgeries and an amputation and contracted several urinary tract infections, bed sores, malnutrition and pneumonia because the facility was understaffed to reduce labor costs and to increase profits, according to the daughters suit, which alleged elder abuse, fraud and wrongful death.  The company settled the litigation under undisclosed terms and denied the allegations.  The charges filed by Californias attorney general against Skilled Healthcares Eureka nursing home recalled allegations against that same home in the 2010 class-action lawsuit against the company that led to the $63 million settlement.  Company E-Mails  The jury found Skilled Healthcare, based in Foothill Ranch, California, refused to hire enough nurses to meet the states requirement that enough should be on hand to provide at least 3.2 hours of care per patient each day. The company fell short of the mandate on more than 1.2 million patient days between 2003 and 2009, the jurors calculated.  You cant make people lie in their own filth because youre too focused on profits to hire enough nurses, said Bob Hart, a retired mechanic and the jurys foreman.  Roland Rapp, Skilled Healthcares general counsel, said California regulators had never issued clear guidance on what positions counted in the nursing requirement.  Our facilities did not compromise care to achieve any particular staffing metric, he said.  The 250,000 company e-mails produced in the case showed repeated tensions between controlling costs and caring for patients inside the company.  It feels like were a three-legged dog whose owner thinks a little finger shaking and kicking will grow that other leg, wrote the administrator of the companys Granada, California, nursing home after his staffs overtime hours were cut.  Back Door  Jose Lynch, Skilled Healthcares president, made managers at individual homes report labor expenses daily, and praised them when they fell -- even when there werent enough nurses on hand to meet state requirements, according to the e-mails.  In June 2004, he responded to an e-mailed update saying four of the companys five nursing homes in Humboldt County were below the minimum by telling regional managers, Nice hours control. Keep on that overtime. The company declined to make Lynch available for comment.  In November 2005, after an unexpected rise in patient discharges, he e-mailed executives, including Chief Executive Officer Boyd Hendrickson, warning, Bad news and VERY bad weekend. In the same note, Lynch asked two of his managers to have their team really watch the back door, nursing-home jargon for patient discharges.  Pushing Patients  Rapp, the companys general counsel, declined to comment on the e-mails. Clinicians are always balancing the interests of the federal government in managing costs at a reasonable level and providing the best possible care to the patient, he said.  Kelly Atkins, who ran the companys California division, forwarded Lynchs warning to her team, telling them to watch labor and overtime rigorously!! and to push patient lengths of stay and Medicare reimbursement levels. She told one of the clinical supervisors to have all quality-assurance nurses review back door and give report.  Will do, the supervisor responded, asking in the same e-mail if any specific facilities had a lot of discharges during the last 2 weeks?  Seven days later, Lynch e-mailed again, saying he was shocked by the latest census, or patient count, adding, Thanks for helping dig with your people this week on whether intake volume is not coming in like they are reporting or if we can have Clinical help on the discharge side.  Visibly Soiled  Trial evidence and state health records show staff was chronically short at the companys Eureka Healthcare and Rehabilitation Center, where the unnamed patients in Californias criminal complaint resided.  A 77-year-old mentally impaired woman choked to death on her dinner in 2005 when she was left unsupervised in the dining hall, according to a state disciplinary citation. A nursing aide passing out food trays had left the room in search of other employees to help feed the patients, the report said. Rapp said Skilled Healthcare may have appealed the citation but that he couldnt recall the resolution.  Just two weeks before the womans death, state inspectors had found 28 care deficiencies at the Eureka home, including one for failing to meet the minimum nursing requirement on more than 70 percent of the days in the previous two months, according to court records in another case.  Patients would line the halls in their wheelchairs visibly soiled because the Eureka facility didnt have enough nurses to take them to the toilet, according to court testimony from Sheila Newell, who ran the nursing homes social services department from 2003 through 2007.  Still Investigating  Some of the larger patients had to choose between spending the day in their wheelchairs in soiled clothing, or being hoisted back into bed to have their garments changed, which meant staying in bed the rest of the day because there werent enough nurses to transfer them back to their chairs, according to Newell.  If they went to bed, they had to stay in bed, she testified.  When state health inspectors showed up, usually around lunchtime, Eurekas public address system announced Dr. Arnold is in the building, which meant all managers had to rush to the dining hall and appear to be helping patients eat their lunch, Newell testified.  State and federal prosecutors have said in court motions that theyre continuing to investigate the company for other possible violations stemming from facts uncovered in the class- action trial. Rapp said its unfair that prosecutors are still investigating the company for the issues covered in the trial.

Geithner  told Congress that the U.S. hit its statutory debtlimit, necessitating emergency steps announced last week as away to keep funding the government and avoid default.

The letter saidthe Treasury was taking similar action for the Postal ServiceRetiree Health Benefits Fund.  Federal retirees and employees will be unaffected bythese actions, according to Geithners letter. It said thefunds will be made whole after Congress increases the debtlimit.  Geithner said on Dec. 26 the department expected to hit the$16.4 trillion debt ceiling today, while various extraordinarymeasures he can take would create about $200 billion ofheadroom to avoid possible default.  Asked whether the U.S. debt limit was reached, a Treasuryofficial responded by e-mail: As Secretary Geithner laid outlast week, we will reach the statutory debt limit today.  Debt Limit  Republicans have attempted to use the need for a debt-limitincrease to force deeper spending cuts, replicating the 2011showdown that caused the U.S. to come within days of default andled to a credit-rating downgrade.

Clinton, 65, the former U.S. senator and first lady who is one of the worlds best-known figures, hasnt been seen in public for more than three weeks as her aides have disclosed scant details about her illness, saying first that she had come down with a stomach virus and then that she had fallen and suffered a concussion.  In the course of a follow-up exam today, Secretary Clintons doctors discovered a blood clot had formed, stemming from the concussion she sustained several weeks ago, Philippe Reines, deputy assistant secretary, said in an e-mail yesterday. She is being treated with anti-coagulants and is at New York- Presbyterian Hospital so that they can monitor the medication over the next 48 hours.  Reines said last night that doctors will continue to assess her condition, including other issues associated with her concussion. They will determine if any further action is required.  While Reines offered no details on the location of the blood clot,  Allen Taylor , chief of cardiology at Medstar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, said it may have been in her legs because recovery from her concussion has kept her largely sedentary.  Blood Thinners  Taylor, who isnt involved in her case, said clots known as deep vein thrombosis are common in people who are less mobile, including those who are hospitalized or fly long distances. The condition is highly treatable using blood thinners, he said.  Clinton has experienced a blood clot before. In 1998, while she was first lady, she had the most significant health scare Ive ever had, she told the New York Daily News in an October 2007  interview . She recalled suffering what the newspaper described as terrible pain behind her right knee as she campaigned on behalf of New Yorks Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.  She thought she simply needed rest until a White House doctor told her to rush to nearby Bethesda Naval Hospital, in Bethesda,  Maryland , where doctors diagnosed a large blood clot behind her right knee.  Popular Figure  Clinton is among the most popular figures in the Obama administration and one some Democrats want to run for president in 2016. A Bloomberg National Poll conducted Dec. 7-10 found shes viewed positively by 70 percent of Americans, compared with a 55 percent favorable rating for President  Barack Obama .  Her hospitalization came after she had said she would testify in January before congressional committees on the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. The secretary canceled previously scheduled appearances before House and Senate committee because of her illness.  Its absolutely essential that shed testify before leaving office, Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said yesterday on Fox News Sunday.  Clinton, who has announced she would step down as secretary of state, has repeatedly said she has no plans to return to politics and would instead like to focus her future work on issues related to the rights of women and girls.  Formidable Person  Former Republican House Speaker  Newt Gingrich , an unsuccessful candidate in the 2012 presidential primaries, said Dec. 9 on NBCs Meet the Press that if Clinton sought the presidency, it would be virtually impossible to stop her for the nomination.  The Republican Party is incapable of competing at that level, Gingrich said, describing Clinton as a very formidable person.  Obama has nominated John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to succeed Clinton, and members of both parties have said they expect him to win Senate confirmation.  Clinton has been known for her prodigious travels as secretary of state. She has traveled 949,706 miles and visited 112 countries over 401 days, according to the State Department website. The department calculates that Clintons time in the air amounts to 2,084.21 hours, or 86.8 days.  Terse Updates  Clintons staff has provided only terse updates on her health since she last appeared at a public event on Dec. 7 in  Belfast  at the end of a trip that also took her to the Czech Republic,  Belgium  and Ireland.  On Dec. 9, the day before Clinton was set to leave again on a trip to North Africa, her staff announced that she was sick with a stomach virus and that her departure would be delayed by 24 hours. The next day, her trip was canceled and Deputy Secretary of State William Burns left to attend a conference on Syria on Clintons behalf.  On Dec. 15, Reines put out a statement disclosing that Clinton had suffered a concussion.  While suffering from a stomach virus, Secretary Clinton became dehydrated and fainted, sustaining a concussion, he said in the statement. He said she would be regularly monitored by doctors and would work at home on their recommendation.  Reines provided no details about when the concussion occurred.  Worked From Home  State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Dec. 18 that Clinton was on the mend and had been working from home, speaking to her senior staff by telephone and e-mail, reading through the report she had requested on the Benghazi attack and working on other issues, including  Syria  and North Korea. Shes going to be absolutely fine, Nuland said.  On Dec. 19, the State Department staff announced Clinton wouldnt be taking any trips through mid-January as her doctors had said she shouldnt fly for any significant duration in the weeks ahead. On Dec. 28, Reines said Clinton would be returning to work in the coming week.  A few Republicans such as John Bolton, the former ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush, had suggested that Clinton was suffering from a diplomatic illness to avoid having to testify on Libya.  Nuland dismissed such speculation on Dec. 18 as completely untrue.  Anti-Coagulants  The statement that Clinton is being treated with anti- coagulants indicates the clot isnt in her brain, Taylor, the cardiologist, said.  You wouldnt put a person on blood thinners if they had a head injury, such as a subdural hematoma, or a clot in the brain itself, he said. You could have a bleed inside the brain. This is likely something completely different.  The main risk from a deep vein thrombosis is that it can break off and travel to the lungs, where the clot can turn deadly, Taylor said. The serious complications can be prevented with appropriate use of blood thinners, he said.  People who have had a deep vein thrombosis remain at higher risk for developing subsequent clots, and often take preventive medicine to reduce the risk.  Often flying is a particular risk -- people take certain measures, Taylor said. Getting up and moving around is the most important thing. She probably flies more than anyone else in the entire world.

A pledge in July from European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  to do whatever it takes to safeguard the monetaryunion pulled down  Spain s borrowing costs from a euro-erarecord. Irish securities delivered the best returns since 1993as the ECB outlined a bond-buying plan that eased tension in Europe s three-year-old debt crisis. German bunds underperformedFrench and Austrian peers as record-low yields dented demand forthe regions top-rated fixed-income assets.  We have seen a significant change in sentiment, saidMohit Kumar, head of European fixed-income strategy at DeutscheBank AG in  London .  Portugal , Ireland,  Italy , theyve all donereally well. The primary support for the market came from theECB, which removed the risk of an aggressive selloff in any ofthe markets and of a breakup of the euro region.  Portuguese bonds handed investors a 57 percent returnthrough Dec. 28, the largest since at least 1994, according toindexes compiled by Bloomberg and European Federation ofFinancial Analysts Societies. Italian debt rose 21 percent, thefirst annual gain since 2009, while Irish sovereign securitiesreturned 29 percent.  An  index  of all euro-region  government bonds  surged 12percent, the most since Bloomberg began collecting the data in1999, and extending the previous years 1.5 percent advance.  Debt Turmoil  The gains in Italian and Portuguese securities followedtheir worst year on record in 2011, when investors faith inlawmakers ability to manage debt burdens across the regionfaded. As market turmoil deepened, European leaders outlinedplans for tighter bank supervision, budget coordination and aso-called political union, while the ECB said it would backstopthe government-bond market by buying securities of distressedcountries that request aid from the regions rescue fund.  The action prompted money managers at Pacific InvestmentManagement Co., which runs the worlds biggest bond fund, andBlackRock Inc., the worlds largest money manager with $3.7trillion in assets, to buy Spanish and Italian debt.  The ECB has provided much greater stability and hasclipped the tail-risk of an imminent downward spiral across theeuro zone,  Andrew Balls , the London-based head of European portfolio management  at Pimco, said in an interview with  GuyJohnson  on Bloomberg Televisions The Pulse on Dec. 19.Thats a real, significant positive.  An increase in Spanish or Italian yields would represent abuying opportunity for Pimco, he said.  Spains Backstop  Spains bonds were still the euro areas third-worstperformers in 2012, according to the Bloomberg/EFFAS bondindexes, gaining 6.2 percent. German securities, Europesbenchmark government debt, had the lowest return at 4.5 percent,followed by the 5.8 percent gain for Dutch securities.  Spanish 10-year yields fell to 5.26 percent on Dec. 28,down from a euro-era high of 7.75 percent reached on July 25.Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said on Dec. 14 the nation wontlose access to debt markets and doesnt need to trigger the ECBsupport by asking for financial aid at the moment.  We expect Spain to request a bailout program in early2013, Maxime Alimi, a Paris-based euro-area economist at AxaInvestment Managers, wrote in the firms yearly outlook,published on Dec. 13. Elections in Italy in February, and in Germany  in September, will ensure politics is in thespotlight, he wrote.  Receding Risks  Ten-year  Italian yields  fell 261 basis points, or 2.61percentage points, last year to 4.5 percent. The rate rangedbetween 4.35 percent and 7.18 percent.  Spanish and Italian debt was boosted in the first twomonths of the year after the ECB lent 1 trillion euros ($1.3trillion) to banks via two so-called Longer-Term RefinancingOperations in December 2011 and February 2012, some of which wasused to buy bonds. As the effect of the LTROs wore off,borrowing costs began to climb again, prompting the ECB toannounce its bond-buying plan aimed at curtailing bets againstthe currency union.  The introduction of the LTRO continued to provide supportfor non-core markets during the first few months of 2012, saidNishay Patel, a strategist at Citigroup Inc. in London,referring to higher-yielding securities in the region. Risksassociated with a euro-area breakup have receded in the last sixmonths.  Negative Yields  In the so-called core markets, Austrian, Belgian, Dutch andFrench securities all outperformed benchmark bunds afterGermanys  10-year bund yields  dropped to a record-low 1.13percent in June and its two-year rates fell below zero for thefirst time, reaching an all-time low of minus 0.097 percent onAug. 2.  A negative yield means investors will receive less inrepayments on the German securities through maturity than theamount they pay to buy them.  The  extra yield  investors demand to hold French 10-yearbonds instead of bunds narrowed to 69 basis points, down from a2012 high of 153 basis points set on Jan. 6. The so-calledspread between Belgian and German 10-year securities was 74basis points, down from as much as 279 basis points on Jan. 9.  The  Dutch-German spread  narrowed to 18 basis points from 82on April 24, while the Austrian-German difference was 44 basispoints from 162 on Jan. 6.  German 10-year yields may rise to 2.06 percent by the endof the fourth quarter 2013, according to analyst estimatescompiled by Bloomberg.  Record Restructuring  Greece , which last auctioned bonds in March 2010, pushedthrough the biggest sovereign restructuring in history in 2012to reduce its obligations and maintain access to rescue funds.Private investors forgave about 100 billion euros of debt inMarch.  The price of Greeces 2 percent bonds maturing in February2023, which were provided as part of the debt writedown, fell to13.29 percent of face value in May, before climbing to 48.45 asof Dec. 28.  In December, when fresh measures were required to trim thedebt load and release international aid, Greece used 11.3billion euros of its latest loan from Europes bailout fund tobuy back 32 billion euros of the bonds it issued in March.  2013 Sales  Ireland and Portugal, the two other euro-region nationsunder international aid programs, will both return to the  bondmarket  in 2013, according to Lloyds Banking Group Plc. Irelandwill probably sell 8 billion euros of securities, while Portugalmay auction 6.6 billion euros, London-based strategistsAchilleas Georgolopoulos and Vatsala Datta wrote in a Dec. 14note to clients.  The remaining euro-region nations will sell about 789billion euros of bonds this year, down 55 billion euros from2012, they forecast.  There are still many risks for investors to navigategoing forward, said Craig Veysey, head of fixed income atSanlam Private Investments Ltd. in London, a unit of SanlamGroup, which oversees $72 billion. The elections in Italy andGermany may mean politicians steer clear from furthercommitments to extend euro-zone integration, he said.Worries about Greece, Spain and Italy can come to the foreagain.

Shorter Treatment  Finding a treatment for tuberculosis was the passion ofPaul Janssen, founder of J&J unit Janssen Pharmaceutica NV,whose sister died of the disease, said Paul Stoffels, J&Jschief science officer and worldwide chairman of itspharmaceuticals group. U.S. approval will help gain clearance inother countries where the disease is more of a burden, he said.  Well be able to treat many more people and get themcured for tuberculosis, Stoffels said in a telephoneinterview. In the long run, treatment might get simplified,get shorter.  J&J sought approval for the drug, known chemically asbedaquiline, based on the second phase of clinical trials. Thecompany, the worlds second-biggest seller of health-careproducts, plans to start a final-phase trial in the firstquarter of 2013 to study bedaquiline use for nine monthscompared with a placebo, Chrispin Kambili, the global medicalaffairs leader for bedaquiline, said in a telephone interview.  Long-Lasting Cough  Typical treatment currently for multidrug-resistanttuberculosis can be as long as two years, Kambili said. Thedisease is characterized by a long-lasting cough. The studybeginning next year will aim to examine 600 patients over fiveyears.  Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is defined as notresponding to the two most popular drugs that are typicallyfirst used against the illness: isoniazid and rifampicin,according to the WHO.  Approval from the FDA and European authorities where J&Jalso has applied for marketing authorization will help thecompany achieve approval in parts of the world where U.S. and EUopinions serve as references, Stoffels said.  J&J will request a voucher from the FDA that allows acompany that gained approval for a drug to treat a neglecteddisease to seek an expedited review of another treatment. Thecompany hasnt chosen which medicine it will use the voucher onif it gets one, Stoffels said.  While more patients responded to the treatment regimen whenbedaquiline was added to the lineup, more patients who took themedicine in studies also died, Kambili said.  We were puzzled by this observation, he said.  In one trial, 10 of 79 bedaquiline-treated patients diedcompared with two of 81 who took a placebo, the FDA said in a report .

Foreign countries have no right to lecture us, FinanceMinister Taro Aso told reporters at a briefing in  Tokyo  on Dec.28. He said that the U.S. should have a stronger dollar andquestioned whether major Group of 20 nations had stuck topledges from 2009 to avoid competitive currency devaluations.  Japans new Prime Minister Shinzo Abe may accept tradefriction as a cost of spurring growth and countering deflationthrough a looser monetary policy and weaker yen. The currency isset to complete its biggest annual decline in seven years afterAbes Liberal Democratic Party secured a landslide victory inthis months lower-house election. During his campaign, Abe saidforeign-bond purchases were a possible monetary tool.  The LDP wants to boost stock prices before the upper-house election in July next year, and the easiest option forthem is to weaken the currency, said  Satoshi Okagawa , a seniorglobal-markets analyst in Singapore at Sumitomo Mitsui BankingCorp., a unit of Japans second-biggest bank by market value.The explicit policy to weaken the yen is likely to upset theU.S. and  China .  The yen was at 86.08 per dollar as of 7:30 a.m. in  London after touching 86.64 on Dec. 28, the weakest since August 2010.It traded at 113.53 per euro.  Currency Promises  The currency has dropped more than 10 percent versus thegreenback since the end of 2011, set to complete the biggestannual slump since 2005. At the same time, the yen remains about30 percent higher than it was five years ago.  In his Dec. 28 comments, Aso, a former prime minister, saidthat  Japan  and other countries made a promise not to resort tocompetitive currency devaluations at a G-20 meeting in 2009.How many countries have kept the promise? The U.S. should havea stronger dollar. What about the euro? he asked. Foreigncountries have no right to lecture us as Japan is the onlymajor economy to keep the pledge, Aso said.  The U.S. criticized Japan for undertaking unilateral salesof the yen in August and October last year, after Group of Seveneconomies earlier jointly intervened to weaken the currency inthe aftermath of an earthquake and tsunami.  Rather than reacting to domestic strong yen concerns byintervening to try to influence the  exchange rate , Japan shouldtake fundamental and thoroughgoing steps to increase thedynamism of the domestic economy, the Treasury Department saidin a report in December last year.  Shrinking Economy  The  Liberal Democratic Party  faces the task of revivinggrowth after the economy contracted for the past two quarters,meeting the textbook definition of a recession. The nationsindustrial output tumbled more than forecast in November to thelowest level since the aftermath of last years record quake.  At the same time, stock prices are climbing, with ToyotaMotor Corp. at a more than two-year high, as a weaker yen andprospects for central-bank easing brighten the outlook forexporters. Such improvements may cause concern for some ofJapans Asian neighbors.   South Korea  is one of the countries most vulnerable tothe weak yen policy as many export items are in directcompetition, such as cars and electronic goods, said Lee Sang Jae, a Seoul-based economist at Hyundai Securities Co. Japanwill try whatever it can to stop the deflation and to weaken theyen for export growth.  Shirakawas Caution  After a Dec. 28 call with U.S. Treasury Secretary  TimothyF. Geithner , Aso said he had told Geithner that the yen wasmaking some corrections from one-sided moves and Aso would keepmonitoring changes in the currency.  Bank of Japan (8301)  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa, whose five-yearterm ends in April, has rejected suggestions that the bank buyforeign bonds and called for respect for the BOJs independence.Such a policy would amount to currency intervention, which isthe responsibility of the finance minister, he says.  At the same time, the Nikkei newspaper on Dec. 29 citedShirakawa as saying that central bank and government must worktogether to overcome deflation. Abe is pressing for the Bank ofJapan to adopt a 2 percent inflation target, compared with acurrent goal of 1 percent. Consumer prices excluding fresh foodfell 0.1 percent in November from a year earlier, showing thecentral bank is struggling to fulfil even the lesser ambition.  The LDP proposed in its campaign manifesto establishing ajoint BOJ, Ministry of Finance and private sector fund to buyforeign bonds. Takatoshi Ito, a former finance ministry officialand a possible contender to become central-bank governor, saidin a Dec. 6 interview that the BOJ can and should buy foreignbonds, adding that such a move is possible if the financeminister publicly declares support for it.  In a note this month,  Australia  and New Zealand BankingGroup Ltd. said that foreign bond purchases are contrary to thelegislation governing the BOJ. At the same time, its possiblethat the government may cajole the central bank into puttingmoney into a proposed private-public vehicle for investment inforeign asssets, the lender said.

Japan also remains mired in deflation, with consumerprices excluding fresh food dropping 0.1 percent in Novemberfrom a year earlier.  Abe also said Japan will maintain a heightened level ofsecurity in response to incidents last year concerningairspace and territorial waters.  Japan dispatched F-15 fighter jets on Dec. 13 after aChinese marine surveillance propeller plane flew throughJapanese-controlled airspace around uninhabited islands in the East China Sea  claimed by both countries.

A decade-long streak of reduced  taxes  on wages, capital gains, dividends and other income officially will end tomorrow if Congress doesnt act.  The  U.S. Congress  hasnt agreed on legislation to avoid any of the more than $600 billion in tax increases and spending cuts -- known as the fiscal cliff -- set to start taking effect in January.  Below are questions and answers about the status of budget negotiations and what happens next:  Where do the budget talks stand now?  Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat, and Republican Leader  Mitch McConnell  of  Kentucky  worked through the weekend on a bipartisan deal without reaching an agreement. Reid said last night that negotiations were continuing and that there may be announcements on the Senate floor at 11 a.m.  They are still divided over the estate tax, the income level at which higher income taxes would apply, the rates on capital gains and dividends, and how to prevent automatic spending cuts from starting.  Lawmakers emerged from their party caucuses yesterday to say that no deal had been reached yet.  House Speaker  John Boehner , an Ohio Republican, called lawmakers back from holiday vacations to meet yesterday in  Washington . It was the first Sunday session in the House since lawmakers convened in 2010 on health-care legislation. Boehner has said the House would look at whatever the Senate can produce and either pass it or change it.  What happens next?  President  Barack Obama  said Dec. 28 after a White House meeting with congressional leaders that if Republicans and Democrats couldnt reach an agreement, there should be a vote on a scaled-back plan he outlined. It would raise taxes on annual income above $250,000 and extend expanded unemployment insurance benefits.  Senate Democrats  say they will start setting up such a vote if they cant reach an agreement with Republicans.  How did we get here?  The automatic cuts and tax increases were created by Congress and Obama through a confluence of events designed to put pressure on themselves to act on taxes, spending and the  budget deficit .  In 2010, they extended the George W. Bush-era tax cuts for two years, which means breaks on income,  capital gains , dividends and estates are scheduled to expire at the end of this year. Then in 2011 they set up $1.2 trillion in spending cuts to occur over nine years, starting in January 2013, as part of a deal to raise the U.S. debt ceiling. This year, lawmakers continued a two-percentage-point reduction in the  payroll tax  through Dec. 31.  Also, Congress hasnt passed legislation that would keep millions more Americans from paying the alternative minimum tax this year and would extend other tax credits and deductions for 2012 tax returns as lawmakers have done in years past.  What about the debt ceiling?  The U.S. will reach the $16.4 trillion debt limit today, Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said Dec. 26. Geithner said he will take extraordinary measures to postpone a U.S. default and finance about $200 billion in deficit spending in 2013.  Typically, that would be enough for two months. Geithner didnt set a specific deadline because of the lack of certainty about tax rates and spending.  Republicans have attempted to use the need for a debt-limit increase to force deeper spending cuts, replicating the 2011 showdown that caused the U.S. to come within days of default and led to a credit-rating downgrade.  So when will the debt limit be addressed?  Aides and lawmakers in both parties say they likely wont address the debt limit in a year-end deal.  That decision sets up a fight over the next few months in which Republicans use the debt ceiling as leverage to force Obama to accept cuts in entitlement programs. Obama has said he wont negotiate about the debt ceiling; he hasnt explained what that means.  What happens if the U.S. goes over the cliff?  The  Congressional Budget Office  projects that the economy would go into recession in the first half of 2013 if the tax increases and spending cuts occur and arent retroactively resolved.  How have markets reacted to the lack of a deal so far?  U.S. stocks fell for a fifth day Dec. 28, the longest slump since September, as lawmakers approached the fiscal-cliff deadline without a compromise. The  Standard & Poors 500 Index (SPX)  lost 1.1 percent to close at 1,402.43.  Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields capped their first weekly gain in a month as the cliff loomed. The securities lagged behind stocks this year by the most since 2009, with equities returning about eight times more than bonds.  How will that affect tax filing season?  If Congress doesnt pass legislation to prevent expansion of the AMT, as many as 100 million U.S. households may not be able to file their tax returns until at least late March 2013, according to the  Internal Revenue Service . Thats because the IRS programmed its computer systems assuming that Congress would eventually patch the AMT.  The tax filing season is scheduled to start in January and run through mid-April. A later start probably would delay refunds to taxpayers.  Steven Miller , the acting IRS commissioner, has said there is no magic time when the agency would make a decision about delaying the filing season.  Congress also hasnt extended dozens of  tax  breaks for 2012 returns that expired at the end of 2011, such as the ability to deduct sales taxes and teachers out-of-pocket expenses.  What do these negotiations mean for 2013 paychecks?  The IRS has said it will issue guidance by today on paycheck withholding for 2013, which depends on the income-tax rates Congress is debating. Higher rates would mean less take- home pay for workers starting as early as the first paycheck in January. Both Democrats and Republicans support extending current rates for families making less than $250,000. They disagree on whether to raise levies for top earners. Rates are scheduled to increase for all income levels Jan. 1 if Congress doesnt act.  What about the payroll tax?  Workers also may see a reduction in paychecks starting in January if Congress lets the payroll tax cut of the past two years expire today as scheduled. That tax increase is more likely than the income tax increases because lawmakers in both parties have said they want to let it expire.  The payroll tax cut shaved 2 percentage points off of the 6.2 percent tax that pays for employees portion of  Social Security . Workers making $50,000 and being paid twice a month will see their paychecks shrink by $41.67.  What has the Senate passed?  The Senate passed a bill in July that would extend the tax cuts for one year on income up to $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for married couples. It also would extend tax credits from the 2009 stimulus law for low-income families and college students. It was silent on the estate tax because of disagreements among Democrats, and it didnt address the automatic spending cuts.  That bill is also unconstitutional because it is a tax bill that started in the Senate, not the House.  What has the House passed?  The House, controlled by Republicans, passed a bill in August that would extend the expiring tax cuts for one year and begin a process for an overhaul of the U.S. tax code. It was silent on extending tax credits from the 2009 stimulus law for low-income families and college students. The House has passed bills that would delay automatic spending cuts -- known as sequestration -- by replacing them with other cuts.  What is sequestration and how does it work?  Sequestration is the official name for the automatic spending cuts, half of which would be in defense programs. The cuts are across-the-board, giving agency officials little discretion as to how to achieve them. Defense programs would face a 9.4 percent cut and most other agencies would be cut by 8.2 percent, the administration said earlier this year.  The cuts begin taking effect Jan. 2. Republicans want to find other spending reductions to replace them. Democrats are willing to use the higher taxes to delay the cuts.  Isnt this Congress almost over?  Yes. The new Congress elected Nov. 6 starts its term on Jan. 3.  What does that mean?  That means the legislative process must start over and all bills proposed or awaiting action will die. Democrats will gain seats in the House and Senate. Republicans will still control the House and have procedural power to block action in the Senate.  Is it really a cliff or is it more of a slope?  A slope would be a better metaphor. Most of the effects -- the higher income tax rates and the spending cuts -- would occur gradually during 2013 and not deliver an immediate economic shock. For example, the Treasury Department has at least some authority to freeze paycheck withholding even if higher tax rates are in place.  Are there some changes that wont depend on negotiations?  Yes. A 3.8 percent increase on income earned from investments, rents and so-called passive activities is set to take effect Jan. 1 as a result of the 2010 health-care law. That means U.S. income tax rates for top earners and investors will rise for the first time since 1993.  Republicans opposed the health-care law and wanted to repeal it if Obama didnt win re-election. The law imposes a 0.9 percent additional tax increase on wages next year. Both surtaxes apply to individuals earning more than $200,000 a year or married couples earning more than $250,000. An excise tax on medical devices also will take effect.  -- With assistance from Inyoung Hwang in  New York  and Andrew Rummer in  London .

The National Football League Players Association claimedthe league hid a $123 million-per-club salary cap for the 2010season. The players sought $3 billion in damages, saying ownersviolated an earlier agreement requiring uncapped salaries thatseason.  U.S. District Judge David S. Doty in  Minneapolis  todayrejected the claim, finding that the earlier agreement, reachedin 2006, had expired and the players had waived such claimsthrough their 2011 collective-bargaining agreement. The 2011accord, settling a labor dispute, included a stipulation ofdismissal of any claims, pending or not, Doty said.  Because the stipulation of dismissal was executed after the2006 agreement expired, the court is without jurisdiction toenforce it, Doty said. The NFLPA released the claims itattempts to assert in the underlying action.  The players will consider any and all other options inlight of this decision, George Atallah, an NFLPA spokesman,said in an e-mail today. We respect the judges order, but itdoes not mean that the owners didnt collude.  The NFL team owners colluded on salaries for the 2010season, and the players were unaware of this when thecollective-bargaining agreement was reached in August 2011,Jeffrey Kessler, a lawyer for the players, said in a Sept. 6hearing before Doty.  Desperate Time  It never occurred to us that there was collusion over asalary cap, Kessler said at the September hearing. We wouldhave asserted that claim at that desperate time for the players,had we known about it.  There was no secret salary cap, Gregg Levy, a lawyerfor the league with Covington & Burling, said at that hearing.The union agreed to give up that claim in exchange for a newagreement.  The broader lawsuit was brought by the late PhiladelphiaEagles Hall of Famer Reggie White.

NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said the league would respondto the union today. The NHL and its players association,seeking to end a 106-day lockout, met face-to-face yesterday in New York  to discuss details of a 10-year offer.  The league presented the players union with its mostrecent offer on Dec. 27. After reviewing it, the union counteredwith its latest offer yesterday. The NHL is seeking a deal byJan. 11 to allow for training camps to begin the next day with a48-game season set to start Jan. 19.  Their response was a comprehensive one, dealing with afull slate of issues that we raised in the proposal we putforth, Bettman told reporters. Were in the process ofreviewing their response.  The two sides hadnt held face-to-face negotiations sinceDec. 13 when federal mediators were present.  Under the leagues latest offer, the limit of individualfree-agent contracts was raised to six years from five years orseven years if a team re-signs its own player, the  AssociatedPress  reported, citing a person familiar with the document thatit didnt identify. It also offered to raise the salary variancefrom one year to another to 10 percent from 5 percent.  The latest proposal would run through the 2021-22 season,with both sides having the right to opt out after eight years,AP said.  The league has canceled 625 games, or 51 percent of theseason, through Jan. 14. In 1994-95, an NHL lockout ended Jan.11 and a 48-game schedule began on Jan. 20. A lockout wiped outthe 2004-05 season, the only time an entire schedule was lost toa labor dispute in a major North American sports league.  The sides are arguing over how to split revenue and otherissues, including salary arbitration and the length ofunrestricted free agency. League revenue grew to $3.3 billionlast season, up 50 percent from $2.2 billion in 2003-04.  Under the previous agreement, players received 57 percent,or $1.9 billion, of the income. The remaining $1.4 billion, or43 percent, was shared among the leagues 30 team owners. Theleague this time has offered a 50-50 split.

(7201) President  Carlos Ghosn  among those impressed with new JapanesePrime Minister Shinzo Abes ability to weaken the yen againstall major global currencies.  We are way long from what I consider a neutralterritory of about 100 yen to the dollar, the Brazilian-bornpresident of  Japan s second-largest automaker told reportersduring a year-end briefing at Nissans headquarters in Yokohama,Japan. Please bring it back to the neutral territory so thatwe can do our job without a handicap.  Ghosns  exchange-rate  dissatisfaction, echoed by  ToyotaMotor Corp. (7203)  President  Akio Toyoda , underscores the frustrationsof manufacturers in a country where the yen surged almost 40percent over four years to a postwar high in 2011. While pledgesof weakening the currency and stoking inflation helped Abe andhis party win a landslide victory in Japans mid-Decemberelections, currency forecasters predict the yen may strengthenfrom current levels.  The yen has tumbled more than 10 percent this year,including a 4 percent drop in the past month, making it theworst performer among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked byBloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.  Prior to 2012, it had been the best-performing majorcurrency for three of the preceding four years, underminingJapanese automakers ability to compete against Detroit-based General Motors Co. (GM) , Germanys  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  and South Koreas Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)   Shifting Production  Toyoda, who heads Japans largest automaker, said at aseparate year-end briefing last month that compared with decadesago, the yen has more than quadrupled.  The exchange rate is at a level that is beyond whatcompanies can cope with and continues to hurt Japanesemanufacturers, Toyoda said on Dec. 20, speaking as chairman ofthe Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association.  Ghosn, who made his comments before Abes swearing in aspremier, has led Japanese automakers in moving productionoutside Japan in the past years to counter the yens strength.Nissan made three in four vehicles outside Japan, compared withabout half for Toyota, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Every one-yen move against the dollar will have 20 billionyen ($232 million) and 35 billion yen impact on Nissan andToyotas annual operating profits, respectively, according tothe companies.  Regarding  China , where a territorial dispute with Japan ledto a consumer backlash that hurt sales of Japanese brands in theworlds biggest auto market, Ghosn said the company willcontinue monitor to assess how long the slump persists.  China Risks  Nissan, which announced in June that it will invest 5billion  yuan  ($803 million) to build a new plant in Dalian,northeast China, doesnt see risks to current and plannedcapacity, Ghosn said. The country accounted for about a quarterof its worldwide sales in 2011.  If this turmoil is going to have a long term impact onChinese consumers shying away from Japanese brands, obviously wewill have to reflect it in our long-term plans, he said.  Nissan will be watching very carefully the first fewmonths of each government in Japan and China, before makingdecisions on further investments in China, Ghosn said.  The automakers sales have fallen every month in Chinasince September, when large-scale anti-Japan protests broke upand consumers shunned Japanese products over the disputed isletsknown as Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese.  Peaceful Path  Japanese carmakers may not have to change theirstrategies in China immediately, said  Satoru Takada , a Tokyo-based auto analyst at Toward the Infinite World Inc. But theyare approaching closer and closer to the timing that they willhave to re-examine the plans.  Abe, who was sworn in as prime minister on Dec. 26, alsocampaigned by pledging to defend Japanese territory and waters.China hopes Japan will stick to its path of peacefuldevelopment and play a positive role in maintaining peace in Asia , Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told abriefing in Beijing Dec. 26.  Ghosn said he expects 2013 to be another record year forthe global  auto industry , with total sales rising 3 to 4 percentto 82 million to 83 million vehicles.  Demand will mainly come from China, the U.S.,  Russia ,India,  Brazil , the  Middle East  and Southeast Asia, while Europewill extend declines and Japan is very likely to contract ifthe government doesnt intervene to boost consumption, he said.  Toyoda said he hopes bilateral ties between Japan and Chinanormalize as soon as possible to prevent further impact on autosales.  Next year, I want it to be a peaceful year where nothinggoes wrong, said Toyoda. A year where we can go to workevery day, build every day, and sell every day. Thats it.  Ghosn said Nissan remains committed to electric vehicletechnology even as the sales of EVs fall short of the companystarget in 2012. The maker of the battery-powered Leaf vehiclesaid last month that it plans to introduce or refresh 15 hybridmodels by March 2017.

McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, on the Senate floor today called on lawmakers to pass the tax-relief portion of a budget agreement being negotiated that would continue lower tax rates for all but the highest earners.  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 137.99 points, or 1.1 percent, to 13076.10 at 3:04 p.m. The Standard & Poors 500 Index gained 20.62, or 1.5 percent, to 1423.05.  President  Barack Obama  said before McConnell spoke that a deal to avert tax increases and spending cuts starting tomorrow is within sight though it hasnt been completed.  It appears that an agreement to prevent this New Years tax hike is within sight, but its not done, Obama told a group of what the White House described as middle-class taxpayers. He urged people to keep the pressure on over the next 12 hours or so; lets get this thing done.  Lawmakers are seeking to avert tax increases and spending cuts that make up the so-called fiscal cliff. Even if a deal is reached and can get through both chambers of Congress, it would be more limited than Obama and leaders of both parties sought and would set up another fight early in 2013 over the budget and the federal debt limit.  The president said the main sticking point was how to avoid the automatic federal spending cuts set to begin tomorrow. Those may not always be the smartest cuts and would affect defense as well as programs like Head Start, he said.  Under a proposed deal, income tax cuts would be extended for annual income up to $450,000, said an official who spoke on condition of anonymity, with rates rising to 39.6 percent on income above that. Expanded  unemployment insurance  would be continued through 2013.  Senate Democrats  Some  Senate Democrats  expressed resistance toward an income threshold for increased tax rates that would be higher than the $250,000 they sought.  Senator  Tom Harkin , an Iowa Democrat, said on the Senate floor this morning that he doesnt support a $450,000 income threshold, signaling that a deal reached by Vice President  Joe Biden  and McConnell could lose the votes of some Democrats.  This is one Democrat that doesnt agree with that -- at all, Harkin said on the Senate floor. Were going to lock in forever the idea that $450,000 a year is middle class in America?  Harkin didnt answer directly when asked later whether he might use Senate rules to block a deal he didnt agree with, saying only that there could be extended debate.  Capital gains  and dividend rates would rise to 23.8 percent for top earners, including taxes as part of the 2010 health-care law, according to the official.  Estate tax rates would rise to 40 percent on amounts above $5 million per person. Extensions of business tax breaks would continue through the end of 2013. The measure would permanently prevent an expansion of the alternative minimum tax.  Wind Energy  The Senate Finance Committee in August approved extending miscellaneous tax breaks through 2013, including benefits for  wind energy , corporate research and multinationals overseas finance operations.  The potential deal also would avert a cut in Medicare payments to doctors through 2013.  Earlier in the day, Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said negotiators could reach a U.S. budget deal today that would protect all but top earners from a tax increase next year.  Democrats have sought to delay the automatic federal spending cuts for two years, at a cost of $200 billion, though they havent identified other savings to pay for it.  Biden and McConnell are discussing a possible two-month delay in the spending cuts, while Senate Democratic leaders had been pushing for at least a yearlong extension, according to a congressional aide close to the negotiations. A two-month pause in the automatic cuts would require $24 billion in additional savings that Republicans are demanding in exchange.  Budget Savings  Republicans insisted that the spending cuts be offset with savings elsewhere in the budget and that new revenue should be used to reduce the deficit.  Representative Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican, said House Speaker  John Boehner  has been hands off in the Senate negotiations. He said if a deal includes averting automatic cuts, it would need to include spending cuts in exchange for those.  When it comes here well figure out what we can pass, Rogers told reporters. If we dont have real spending cuts, I dont think it could pass the  House of Representatives . He said a House vote would be more likely tomorrow even if the Senate agreed on a plan today.  Boehner has previously said he would bring any budget legislation passed by the Senate to the House floor, though members may decide to amend it.  Tax Cuts  Tax cuts first enacted during  George W. Bush s presidency are scheduled to expire tonight. Obama and other Democrats have sought to extend the reductions for married couples income up to $250,000 a year while letting tax rates rise for income above that amount. Republicans oppose tax rate increases for any income level.  Allowing the fiscal changes to take effect would cause a recession in the first half of 2013, according to the  Congressional Budget Office .  In the event the Senate cant reach a compromise, Obama has asked Reid to ready a bare-bones bill for a vote today to extend expanded unemployment benefits and tax cuts on family income up to $250,000.  If Congress does nothing, taxes will rise in 2013 by an average of $3,446 for U.S. households, according to the nonpartisan  Tax Policy Center  in  Washington .  Tax filing for as many as two-thirds of U.S. taxpayers could be delayed into at least late March. Defense spending would be cut, and the economy would probably enter a recession in the first half of 2013, according to the Congressional Budget Office.  The effects of the higher tax rates and federal spending cuts would accumulate over a matter of months. Congress could reverse them by acting retroactively in 2013.

Taxpayers and investors wont see immediate effects of the changes, which would accumulate over a matter of months. Congress could reverse them by acting retroactively early in 2013. There are signs it may do that.  Earlier today, Senate Minority Leader  Mitch McConnell  said lawmakers were very, very close to a deal to avert the budget changes, known as the fiscal cliff. The Kentucky Republican called on lawmakers to pass the tax-relief portion of a budget agreement being negotiated that would continue lower tax rates for all but the highest earners.  The only House votes still scheduled for today are on non- budget items, according to the chambers schedule. Republicans left open the option to return if needed.  House Republicans  gathered in a private conference meeting late this afternoon in  Washington  time, and Senate Republicans also were meeting.  I dont see how you get something voted on today, said Representative Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican. Even if the Senate gets a hand-shake deal, the consensus among lawmakers is that it would be really hard for a vote to occur before midnight, Rogers told reporters.  Lengthy Dispute  After more than 17 months of bickering, Congress and President  Barack Obama  have yet to finalize an agreement to avert the fiscal cliff. Even if a deal is reached and can get through both chambers of Congress in coming days, it would be more limited than Obama and leaders of both parties sought. It also would set up another fight early in 2013 over the budget and the federal debt ceiling.  Obama said before McConnell spoke that a deal to avert tax increases and spending cuts starting tomorrow was within sight, though it hadnt been completed.  It appears that an agreement to prevent this New Years tax hike is within sight, but its not done, Obama said in nationally televised remarks to a group of what the White House described as middle-class taxpayers. He urged people to keep the pressure on over the next 12 hours or so; lets get this thing done.  Automatic Cuts  The president said the main sticking point was how to avoid the automatic federal spending cuts set to begin tomorrow. Those may not always be the smartest cuts and would affect defense as well as government services such as the Head Start education program, he said.  The Standard & Poors 500 Index rallied 1.7 percent to 1,426.20 at 4 p.m. in  New York . The 10-year Treasury yield increased six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 1.76 percent at 2 p.m. in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.  Under a proposed deal, income tax cuts would be extended for annual income up to $450,000, said an official who spoke on condition of anonymity, with rates rising to 39.6 percent on income above that. Expanded  unemployment insurance  would be continued through 2013.  Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid , who controls the chambers floor schedule, hasnt signed off on any potential deal, according to a Democratic aide. No deal could reach the floor without Reids approval.  Democratic Resistance  Some  Senate Democrats  expressed resistance toward an income threshold for increased tax rates that would be higher than the $250,000 they and Obama have been seeking.  Senator  Tom Harkin , an Iowa Democrat, said on the Senate floor that he doesnt support a $450,000 income threshold, signaling that any deal reached by Vice President  Joe Biden  and McConnell could lose the votes of some Democrats.  This is one Democrat that doesnt agree with that -- at all, Harkin said on the Senate floor. Were going to lock in forever the idea that $450,000 a year is middle class in America?  Harkin didnt answer directly when asked later whether he might use Senate rules to block a deal he didnt agree with, saying only that there could be extended debate.  Capital gains  and dividend rates would rise to 23.8 percent for top earners, including taxes as part of the 2010 health-care law, according to the official.  Estate Taxes  Estate tax rates would rise to 40 percent on amounts above $5 million per person. Extensions of business tax breaks would continue through the end of 2013. The measure would permanently prevent an expansion of the alternative minimum tax.  The Senate Finance Committee in August approved extending miscellaneous tax breaks through 2013, including benefits for  wind energy , corporate research and multinationals overseas finance operations.  The potential deal also would avert a cut in Medicare payments to doctors through 2013.  Biden and McConnell discussed a possible two-month delay in the spending cuts, while Senate Democratic leaders had been pushing for at least a yearlong extension, according to a congressional aide close to the negotiations. A two-month pause in the automatic cuts would require $24 billion in additional savings that Republicans are demanding in exchange.  Republicans insisted that the delayed spending cuts be offset with savings elsewhere in the budget and that new revenue should be used to reduce the deficit.  Hands Off  Rogers said House Speaker  John Boehner  has been hands off in the Senate negotiations. He said if a deal includes averting automatic cuts, it would need to include spending cuts in exchange for those.  When it comes here well figure out what we can pass, Rogers told reporters of a deal. If we dont have real spending cuts, I dont think it could pass the House of Representatives.  Boehner, an  Ohio Republican , has previously said he would bring any budget legislation passed by the Senate to the House floor, though members may decide to amend it.  Tax cuts first enacted during  George W. Bush s presidency are scheduled to expire tonight. Obama and other Democrats have sought to extend the reductions for married couples income up to $250,000 a year while letting tax rates rise for income above that amount. Republicans oppose tax rate increases for any income level.  Recession Prediction  Allowing the fiscal changes to take effect would cause a recession in the first half of 2013, according to the  Congressional Budget Office .  In the event the Senate cant reach a compromise, Obama has asked Reid to ready a bare-bones bill for a vote today to extend expanded unemployment benefits and tax cuts on family income up to $250,000.  If Congress does nothing, taxes will rise in 2013 by an average of $3,446 for U.S. households, according to the nonpartisan  Tax Policy Center  in Washington.  Tax filing for as many as two-thirds of U.S. taxpayers could be delayed into at least late March. Defense spending would be cut, and the economy would probably enter a recession in the first half of 2013, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

A year ago, he was unemployed.  I feel much better than I did, said Thomson, 33. Theres a lot of construction, just a lot of things going on.  Hiring by homebuilders and software and mobile application developers is helping the western third of the U.S. lead the nation in employment growth, according to Moodys Analytics Inc. and IHS Global Insight Inc. Thats a contrast for the region, which has had the highest unemployment rates following the collapse of the U.S. housing bubble in 2006, with prices plunging in Las Vegas, southern  California  and  Arizona .  Nevadas unemployment fell 2.4 percentage points in the year ended November 2012, the most of any state, to 10.8 percent, though its still the highest in the U.S., according to the Labor Department. Joblessness in Arizona, California, Hawaii and Idaho are all down by at least 1 percentage point in the same period.  The national unemployment rate held at a four-year-low of 7.7 percent in December, according to the median projection in a Bloomberg survey before the Labor Departments Jan. 4 figures. Employers added positions at about the same pace as in the prior month, showing the job market held up as lawmakers searched for a solution to break the fiscal impasse.  U.S. stocks rose, giving the Standard & Poors 500 Index its biggest yearly gain since 2009, as Congress neared a budget deal. The  S&P 500  climbed 1.7 percent to 1,426.19 at the close in New York.  West Leads  Among metropolitan areas with employment of 1 million or more workers, those in the West led in job growth in the 12 months through November, said Lee McPheters, research professor and director of the JPMorgan Chase Economic Outlook Center at the W. P. Carey School of Business at  Arizona State University  in Tempe. Houston topped the list followed by Phoenix, Denver, Seattle and  San Francisco .  We view the West as the nations most dynamic growth region, McPheters said in an e-mail. In 2013, Arizona, Utah, Texas, Washington,  Colorado  and California will be the strongest in the region in job growth and in the top 10 nationally, he said. Over the next five years, Texas and California will add more than 1 million jobs each, more than any other state, he said.  Outpacing Nation  Other assessments buttress the strengthening outlook for the region. The West has been outpacing the rest of the U.S., said Eduardo J. Martinez, senior economist at Moodys Analytics in West Chester,  Pennsylvania . Labor markets crashed when the housing market crashed. Now we are seeing signs of housing prices and  permit  issuance swing from neutral to positive.  Employment in the 13 most western states, including Alaska and Hawaii and excluding Texas, will rise 1.8 percent in 2013 and 2 percent in 2014, according to IHS Global Insight. Thats fastest among U.S. regions both years. Moodys Analytics also said the area has the most favorable job outlook, and forecasts gains of 3 percent annually by 2015.  Homebuilders such as  Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL)  and  Beazer Homes USA Inc. (BZH)  are both benefitting from and helping to fuel the employment increases. Revenue doubled to $167.7 million in its five-state western region for the three months ended October, Horsham, Pennsylvania-based Toll Brothers said Dec. 4. The four- state western market for Atlanta-based Beazer Homes, rose 58 percent to $141.1 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from the same period in 2011.  Housing Snapback  The housing snapback has bolstered Arizonas job market. The  Phoenix area  added 50,700 jobs in the year ended November, almost 11 percent in construction, according to the U.S. Labor Department.  Job hunters in California and Washington have also found opportunities in mobile technology, social networking and electronic commerce.  Tech certainly is a driver for California, said Gary Schlossberg, a San Francisco-based senior economist at Wells Capital Management Inc., which oversees $331 billion, noting in particular the mobile application industry in San Francisco.  Its one of the most dynamic areas, he said. Just look at the rents, and the restaurants at night, its all being driven by tech growth and the spillover from that.  Innovation Nodes  Other cities in the West are also benefitting. We have these nodes throughout the region where innovation is concentrated and not just Silicon Valley, he said.  Kaiser Permanente  said earlier this month it is recruiting for an information technology center opening in January near Denver with plans to add 500 jobs such jobs in Colorado by 2015.  Las Vegas is becoming an emerging market for e-commerce with the relocation of shoe and apparel site Zappos Inc. and its 1,400 employees downtown from the suburbs. Tony Hsieh, founder of the company, now a division of  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , is investing $50 million in downtown-based technology startups, such as iPhone app developer Rumgr, which allows people to buy and sell with others nearby.  The city had the second-highest growth in high-technology jobs in 2011 behind San Francisco, with much of that in e- commerce, according to a  report  by  Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL) , a commercial real estate broker based in  Chicago . The report also cited Phoenix,  Los Angeles  and Orange County as  emerging markets  for high-tech jobs in the West.  Hiring Ripples  That hiring ripples to retail and hospitality industries. Every technology job in a city creates five additional local jobs outside the sector, estimates Enrico Moretti, an economist at  University of California , Berkeley.  McPheters attributes the rebound in the West to  population growth  -- domestic migration to states like Arizona and Nevada from California and the Midwest and international migration to California.  Phoenix, Denver, San Diego  and San Jose, California, were among 15 U.S. cities adding the most people between April 2010 and July 1, 2011, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.  Thats helping boost expansion at companies that put plans on hold when construction stalled and capital dried up during the recession.  RavenBrick, a Denver-based manufacturer of energy-efficient windows, plans to at least triple its workforce over the next year to 60 from 20 employees, said Alex Burney, the firms chief executive officer.  Easy Sell  Denver is an easy sell if youre talking to a qualified person in Detroit or Toledo. Other cities cant compete with the amenities here, he said.  Increased mobility should support the economy and housing in western states, where falling prices have created compelling values, Chief Executive Officer Larry Mizel of Denver-based homebuilder  M.D.C. Holdings Inc. (MDC)  said on a conference call with investors Nov. 1.  The West, we believe, will be an attractive place to live and a good place to build, he said.  Home prices  in the year ended in October rose 21 percent in Arizona, 13 percent in Hawaii, 12 percent in Nevada and Idaho, and 9.2 percent in Utah -- compared with 6.3 percent nationally, according to data provider CoreLogic Inc.  Loan-to-Value  Thomson, in Salt Lake City, said hes become more optimistic because the home he bought in March 2007 no longer has a loan in excess of its value. At one point, it was probably $40,000 underwater.  There is some relief knowing that its not going down anymore, he said. It can only go up.  Home starts in Maricopa County, Arizona, which includes Phoenix, rose an estimated 53 percent over the past two years after falling 87 percent between 2005 and 2010, according to Houston-based Metrostudy, which tracks housing.  The rebound in Phoenix has been stunning, said  Brad Hunter , Metrostudys chief economist. Starts are forecast to more than double by 2016, he said.  For Amy Terrell, 14 months of unemployment ended Dec. 10 when the 40-year-old from Gilbert, Arizona, who applied for hundreds of jobs and went on about 20 interviews, landed a position processing mortgages for  Bank of America Corp .  I dont think it is near where it was a few years ago, but I do think it is improving, she said of the labor market.  Jessica Pierce, executive director of Career Connectors, an Arizona non-profit organization, said job-seekers are attracting more leads and interviews.  Even people who have been unemployed for a while are at least seeing movement, she said. We are seeing people landing much quicker.

Attacks on Shiites are common in Pakistan, where thecommunity accounts for about 15 percent of the countrys 200million people. This year, militants linked to PakistansTaliban movement have targeted Shiites from the ethnic Hazaragroup. At least 320 Shiites died in targeted attacks in 2012 inPakistan, according to New York-based  Human Rights Watch . Over100 were killed in Baluchistan, most of them Hazara, it said.

While the notification would go out to all the Pentagonscivilian workers, only a portion of them would be likely to faceeventual furloughs under the automatic spending cuts known assequestration, said the official, who asked not to be identifieddiscussing personnel plans.  More than $600 billion in tax increases and spending cutsare set to start taking effect this week unless lawmakers canagree on an alternate deficit-reduction plan. The potentialeffect on civilian defense workers gained attention yesterday,when  Senator Lindsey Graham  said Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta told him hed have to send out layoff notices that wouldamount to shooting the Defense Department in the head.  Panetta is worried to death that if we dont fix thesequestration, were going to destroy the finest military in theworld, at a time we need it the most, Graham, a Republicanfrom  South Carolina , said on Fox News Sunday.  Gordon Adams , a professor at American University inWashington who was an official in the White House budget officeduring the Clinton administration, criticized Grahams commentsas hyperbole over what would actually be some unpaid daysoff.  What the secretary probably said was that prudence wouldlead him to notify Pentagon civil servants that there might besome furloughs if sequester happened, Adams said in an e-mail.If sequester is fixed, it might be for none of them.Certainly, none of them are layoffs.  Troops Exempted  The White House budget office told Congress in July that itwould exempt military pay and benefits from sequestration,meaning the administration wont fire uniformed personnel orreduce their pay or benefits.  Panetta has previously raised the prospect of eventualfurloughs for civilians.  I do not expect our day-to-day operations to changedramatically on or immediately after January 2, 2013, shouldsequestration occur, Panetta wrote in a Dec. 20 letter toPentagon officials.

As the Obama administration and congressional leaderssought a last-minute deal to avert tax increases, the debatereturned today to the unresolved cuts in defense and domesticspending.  Congressional Debate  Democrats in Congress want to delay the spending cuts fortwo years, at a cost of $200 billion, though they haventidentified new savings to pay for it.  Republicans are insisting that any delay in sequestrationbe offset with new savings, which remains among the biggeststicking points in the final hours before the deadline.  The Pentagons top 10 contractors rose 1.2 percent at themarkets close in  New York , compared with a 1.7 percent gain inthe  Standard & Poors 500 Index (SPX) , after President  Barack Obama said a deal was within sight.  About $500 billion would be cut from planned defensespending over a decade under sequestration. Those automatic cutswould come on top of $487 billion in defense reductions alreadyplanned over 10 years.  The across-the-board cuts would slice into military weaponsprograms and research funds. The Pentagon reductions may totalas much as $62.3 billion in fiscal 2013, or 12 percent of itsbase budget, which excludes war funding. The governments fiscalyear begins Oct. 1.

The dismissal capped a five-month stretch that began withthe death of Reids oldest son, Garrett, in his room at theEagles training camp from what was later declared a heroinoverdose.  Reids 14-year run with the Eagles was the longest of anyactive coach in the  National Football League . His dismissal wasannounced in a statement from  Jeffrey Lurie , the teams owner.  Lurie, speaking in front of Eagles staff today, saidReids discipline, obsession with being great and ability torelate to players and other organization members wouldnt beforgotten.  I cant tell you the long-lasting and sustainablequalities that Andy brought to this team, and we will have thatforever, Lurie said at the meeting, which was broadcast on theteams website. Its time for a change, for Andy, for us.  Lurie then gave Reid a game ball to commemorate his role asthe coach with the most victories in team history. Afterapplause, Reid said his tenure was the greatest 14 years of mylife.  Sometimes change is good and I know Jeffrey does nothingthat isnt best for the organization, so I know that the nextguy that comes in will be phenomenal, Reid said. Theultimate goal is the Super Bowl. Everybody in this room, I wishyou a big ring on that finger in the near the future.  NFC Championships  The 54-year-old Reid led the Eagles to successive NationalFootball Conference championships from the 2001 to 2004 seasons,and again after the 2008 campaign. Philadelphia beat the AtlantaFalcons to reach the February 2005 Super Bowl, falling 24-21 tothe  New England Patriots .  Reid replaced the fired Ray Rhodes in 1999, leading theteam to a 5-11 record after taking quarterback Donovan McNabbwith the first pick of that years draft, a selection that drewboos from Eagles fans attending the event. The team went 59-21the following five years, reaching the playoffs each season.  Reids teams won seven division titles, earned nine playoffberths and had only two losing seasons through his first 13years. After an 8-8 record in 2011, Lurie said it was the mostdisappointing season since Ive owned the team, and that thefranchise needed to improve in 2012 for Reid to keep his job.  Coaching Tree  Reid steps down with a 130-93-1 record. Several of hisassistants have gone on to NFL head-coaching jobs, including Brad Childress , Ron Rivera,  John Harbaugh ,  Steve Spagnuolo  andLeslie Frasier.  After opening this season at 3-1, with wins over the  NewYork  Giants and  Baltimore Ravens , the Eagles dropped their nexteight, including a 31-6 loss to the Washington Redskins and a30-22 defeat to the Carolina Panthers on Monday NightFootball. The finished the season yesterday with a 42-7 lossto the Giants.  They played the entire campaign without All-Pro defensivetackle Jason Peters, who ruptured his Achilles tendon.Quarterback  Michael Vick  sat out six games after suffering aconcussion in a Nov. 11 loss to the  Dallas Cowboys .  Juan Castillo, who was moved to defensive coordinator in2011 after serving as the teams offensive line coach from 1998to 2010, was fired and replaced by secondary coach Todd Bowlesin October after the Eagles blew a 10-point fourth-quarter leadagainst the Detroit Lions, falling to 3-3. In early December,defensive line coach Jim Washburn was fired following the teamseighth straight defeat, a 38-33 loss to the Cowboys.  Sons Death  Reid took a six-week leave from the team in 2007 after thearrests of his sons, Garrett and Britt. Garrett Reid, who hadbeen working as a strength and conditioning coach for the Eaglessince his release from prison in 2009, was found dead in hisroom at the teams camp at Lehigh University in Bethlehem,Pennsylvania, in August.

Gilts held their biggest weekly gain in a month as U.S.lawmakers debated ways to prevent automatic spending cuts andtax increases that risk triggering a recession. Yields onBritish two-, five-, 10- and 30-year bonds fell to the lowest onrecord this year as the deepening crisis in the euro-region andthe  Bank of England s asset-buying program boosted demand. Thepound is set for its fourth yearly advance against the euro, thelongest since the 17-nation currencys introduction in 1999.  I dont buy into the euro-positive story and ultimatelysterling will be better placed against the euro, said  Neil Mellor , a foreign-exchange strategist at  Bank of New York MellonCorp. (BK)  in  London . You cant look at any euro-zone country andconclude that 2013 is going to be a positive year. Sterling isone of the more difficult currencies to try and pin down. Ourworking presumption is that its going to remain trappedsomewhere between the euro and the dollar.  The pound appreciated 0.3 percent to 81.52 pence per euroas of 12:15 p.m. London time, after gaining 0.5 percent on Dec.28, the biggest increase since Dec. 6.

A rising pound shows the challenges new Bank of EnglandGovernor  Mark Carney , who takes over from  Mervyn King  in July,will face as he tries to boost an economy weighed down byrecession in the euro region. Investors seeking a haven havepushed the pound higher even as the central bank increased bond purchases  to 375 billion pounds, a move that usually debases acurrency.  The Bank of England decided to pause its program of so-called quantitative easing in November, saying risks from the euro-area crisis had receded and inflation concerns persist.  The 10-year gilt yield was little changed at 1.82 percent,after dropping six basis points, or 0.06 percentage points, lastweek, the biggest decline since the period ended Nov. 30.

Capping Yields  That yields have remained near those record lows reflectsboth that domestic monetary policy has been effective in cappingyields and that the euro crisis has been supportive too, said Sam Hill , a fixed-income strategist at  RBC Capital Markets  inLondon. Heading into 2013 it is expected that low and stableyields will continue to be an important part of the slowrecovery. If there is any threat to this status quo it wouldntbe too surprising to see expectations of more QE grow.

Extra Yield  ABS will be attractive relative to RMBS given the spreadpick-up for shorter-dated paper, said Raymond Lee, a Sydney-based portfolio manager at Kapstream Capital, adding that thenotes also help investors diversify away from mortgages. But Idont think it will damage demand as ABS deals are not asabundant as RMBS, and are also much smaller.  Investors are seeking higher-yielding debt as  interestrates  on Australian financial notes fall to the lowest onrecord, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. Therate has fallen 201 basis points this year to 4.30 percent as ofDec. 28. Globally, lenders pay an average 2.48 percent, 231basis points less than on Dec. 31, 2011, the indexes show.  Mortgage providers may look to take advantage of thisdemand in 2013.  RMBS still offers very good value, according to Eva Zileli, a senior manager, secured funding, in group treasury atNational Australia Bank. We would hope to come to the marketnext year with another ABS deal and another RMBS.

Bank of Montreal (BMO) s BMO Capital Markets unit rose to thesecond spot, while  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  was third, datacompiled by Bloomberg show.  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) s TDSecurities unit was fourth, while  Bank of America Corp .sMerrill Lynch unit was fifth. Bankers say they expect moretransactions next year.  We are, based on what we see today, cautiously optimisticthat the level of activity for 2013 will be better than 2012,Goldman Sachs  Canada  Chief Executive Officer John P. Curtin Jr.said in an interview from Toronto.  Canadas economic stability, improvements in the  U.S.economy  and a return of confidence to global markets may fuelmore takeovers in 2013. Mining and energy will drive deals nextyear, while areas such as real estate will continue to be busy,according to investment bankers.  Canadian companies were involved in 2,365 announced dealsvalued at $216.9 billion in 2012, up 19 percent from $182.8billion in 2011 and the highest year since 2007, according toBloomberg data. The figures and rankings are as of today andsubject to change as more deals are recorded.  Royal Banks  RBC Capital Markets  unit worked on 102acquisitions valued at $69.6 billion in 2012, including advisingNexen Inc. on its $15.1 billion sale to Cnooc Ltd. of  China  and Glencore International Plc (GLEN) s C$6.1 billion ($6.13 billion) offerfor Viterra Inc., according to Bloomberg data.  Cnooc-Nexen  We were fortunate we were on the two largest deals,Peter Buzzi, co-head of mergers and acquisitions at RBC CapitalMarkets, said in an interview in Toronto. If you werent onthe Nexen deal its virtually impossible to be top of the leaguetables.  Canadas largest transaction in 2012 was Cnoocs bid forNexen, which received Canadian government approval on Dec. 7.Glencores takeover of Viterra, Canadas largest grain handler,was the second-largest acquisition.  Nexen was a long-standing relationship; weve done a lotof work with the company over the years, Buzzi, 52, said.The relationship we have with Glencore is more recent, andits really a function of our growth outside Canada.  Other large deals included the C$5.2 billion bid forCalgary-based Progress Energy Resources Corp. by PetroliamNasional Bhd. of  Kuala Lumpur , which also received Canadiangovernment approval Dec. 7. BMO Capital Markets advisedProgress, helping the Toronto-based firm land a top-threestanding for a second year with 57 deals valued at $47.7billion.  BMO Evolution  This is an evolution for us, Darryl White, BMO CapitalMarkets head of global investment and corporate banking, saidin an interview from Toronto. If you were to go back five or10 years, in all candor, youd find that our franchise wasunderrepresented as far as the largest deals were concerned.  Goldman Sachs, which ranked fifth last year, reclaimed atop-three spot for the first time since topping Canadianrankings in 2010. The New York-based firm worked on 23 dealsvalued at $46.8 billion, advising companies including Calgary-based Nexen, CGI Group Inc. and  First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FM)   On balance we are pleased with our improved positioningand we are proud of the effort our team put forth, Curtin, 62,said. We would not have our success in Canada without thebroad support and involvement of our colleagues around theworld.  Stronger Market  In 2011, RBC ranked No. 1 after advising on $36.3 billionin deals, edging ahead of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce,with C$36.1 billion of takeovers. BMO Capital Markets was third,with $34.8 billion.  Next year will see a stronger market for takeovers inCanada as the economy improves, aided by a U.S. recovery and astronger China, according to  Mike Boyd , head of global mergersand acquisitions at Toronto-based CIBC. The U.S. economy isforecast to grow 2 percent next year, with Canada growthestimated at 1.8 percent, based on Bloomberg surveys.  I do think M&A in the mining sector will rebound in 2013,with a stronger economic outlook, and well continue to see afair bit of activity in the oil-and-gas sector, said Boyd,whose firm ranked seventh with $25 billion of deals. We sawmuch stronger activity in 2012 than we had in previous years inenergy, and thats a trend well see continue in 2013.  The Canadian governments clarification of InvestmentCanada rules on foreign takeovers, as well as its position onstate-owned enterprises owning  Alberta s oil-sands companies maychange how deals are done, according to Boyd.  Joint Ventures  In the oil-sands we will see more joint ventures,minority investments and those kinds of things, but I dontthink it will have a significant impact on overall M&Aactivity, Boyd said.  Canadian acquisitions in 2012 werent limited to thecountrys resources. Banks were active, with Royal Bank,Canadas largest lender by assets, agreeing on Oct. 23 to buyAlly Financial Inc.s Canadian auto-finance and deposit businessin a $4.1 billion deal.  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) , the third-largestlender, offered in August to buy the Canadian banking operationsof ING Groep NV for C$3.13 billion.  Quebec  companies were also busy. BCE Inc., Canadas largesttelecommunications company, offered to buy Astral Media Inc. ina C$3.38 billion takeover amended in November to addressconcerns by the countrys broadcast regulator on competition andownership concentration in television and radio. AlimentationCouche Tarde Inc. of Laval, Quebec, bought Statoil Fuel & RetailASA, Scandinavias biggest gas-station operator, in a $2.6billion takeover. Montreal-based CGI Group spent $2.7 billion inAugust to buy U.K. computer-services provider Logica Plc.  Competitive Advantage  RBC also topped the rankings based on the number of deals,almost double the 57 transactions by second-place BMO  CapitalMarkets . TD Securities was third with 40 deals, followed by CIBCwith 33 and Scotiabank with 30 deals.  RBCs Buzzi credits his firms relationships with Canadiancompanies and its global platform for its top ranking.  Thats what we put forward as our competitive advantageand every year we hope that results in us being No. 1 in theleague tables, he said.

After all,American institutions  dominate  global surveys of universities,and most lists put a big emphasis on research accomplishments.  Of the 20 top schools for 2012 on the widely used ShanghaiJiao Tong University  rankings , for example, 17 are American.Colleges are carefully evaluated using several indicators ofresearch performance.  Yet there has been little scrutiny of whether most of thisresearch on campuses today is worth it.  Historically, a lot of basic and some applied research atU.S. universities has paid off, with many advances in computerand biomedical sciences. Science, however, like virtuallyeverything else in life, is subject to the law of diminishingreturns. As more and more resources are added to producingsomething, less and less additional output occurs at the margin.  The first $10 billion in annual federal research supportfor higher education probably yields a bigger payoff than thesecond, third or fourth $10 billion increment. Committeesdisbursing funds at the National Institutes of Health or the National Science Foundation  rank proposals and finance those forwhich resources are available, knowing that the 10th proposalapproved is less likely to be scientifically or commercially aspromising as the first or second one.  Applied Research  U.S. total research spending was estimated at $436 billionfor 2012, in a  forecast  done by the Battelle Memorial Institute,absorbing $2.85 of every $100 of U.S. output. What may come as asurprise is how little of the work is directly financed byuniversities themselves -- about 3 percent of the U.S. total,according to the National Science Foundation.  Nor are U.S. universities conducting most of this work,either. More than 80 percent of research dollars in the U.S.goes to applied research and development, very little of whichis financed or carried out in university facilities, but incorporate laboratories.  Although most basic research (investigations of fundamentalprinciples, rather than the commercial application of ideas)occurs in university laboratories, about 40 percent takes placein nonacademic industrial settings. Some of it occurs at federalgovernment-owned research centers managed by universities, suchas the  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory .  Yet far less than 30 percent of university faculty is inthe hard sciences and engineering fields that receive the vastmajority of outside research funds. The work that takes place oncampus is supported largely by giving faculty ever-lowerteaching loads. A  recent survey  of 30,000 faculty by the HigherEducation Research Institute at the University of California atLos Angeles shows an increase in the proportion of faculty withvery low teaching loads. In 2007-08, only 7 percent of Americanfaculty members taught less than four hours a week. By 2011-12,this figure had risen to almost 15.6 percent, according to theUCLA study, and at private universities it exceeds 31 percent.  This work might be worth it if a lot of high-quality orinfluential material was produced. The evidence, however, showsthis isnt the case.  The professors may be teaching less, but they arentexactly spending much time on research, either. The UCLA surveyshows that almost 62.6 percent of faculty members spend fewerthan eight hours a week on research endeavors. The typicalprofessor surveyed publishes only about one paper a year, mostlyfor low-circulation academic journals.  Shakespeare Industry  A study  conducted  by Mark Bauerlein, a professor of Englishat Emory University, for the Center for College Affordabilityand Productivity examined the publications of 156 facultymembers in English departments at four high-quality stateschools (the State University of  New York  at Buffalo and theuniversities of Georgia, Illinois and  Vermont ). The study showsthat there is a glaring mismatch between the resources theseuniversities and faculty members invest and the impact of mostpublished scholarship.  For example, one essay on Shakespeare appearing in a volumeof essays in 2004 collected one citation in the 111 bookswritten on Shakespeare in the years 2008 and 2009. Four otheressays on Shakespeare didnt receive a single citation.  Do we really need  one book a week  written on the Bard (the400th anniversary of whose death is in 2016)? What is the pointof subsidizing scholarly writing that virtually no one reads orcites? Maybe society would be better off if English professorshad done more teaching and less researching, perhaps helping tokeep college costs lower.  Defenders of the emphasis on research argue that itstrengthens teaching. Tell that to the thousands of studentspaying for classes taught by inexperienced adjunct teachers andgraduate students because their professors are off writing oneof the almost 1,000 articles a year published on Shakespearethat very few people read. An  analysis  of 58 studies dealingwith university research and teaching by John Hattie and H.W.Marsh concluded there is zero relationship between research andteaching. Or, as Cardinal  John Henry Newman  put it in 1853 inThe Idea of a University: To discover and to teach aredistinct functions.  If too much university research is of  dubious value  andalso doesnt enhance the quality of teaching, a strong case canbe made to reverse the gradual reduction of classroom time, andthe shift toward research in the past half-century. Incentivesare out of whack. Universities get generous overhead funds fromfederal research grants, and those who publish receive largersalary increases.  A more objective cost-benefit analysis of all universityresearch is overdue. This might help shift attention to where itbelongs: on much-needed improvements in the teaching andtraining of the next generation.

Distributions to creditors have been initiated, theChicago-based company said today in a statement. As part of itsexit from bankruptcy, Tribune Co. also closed on a new $1.1billion  term loan  and a $300 million revolving  credit line .  The company is now in a position to begin a wide-rangingsale of assets including stakes in the Food Network andCareerBuilder Inc., newspapers including the Times and theTribune as well as real estate, Lance Vitanza, managing directorat CRT Capital Group LLC, said in a interview.  Its all for sale, Vitanza said. If they reorganizearound anything it will be the TV assets, but we wouldnt besurprised if they sell those too.  In addition to eight daily newspapers, Tribune Co. owns 23television stations and stakes in more than 50 websites.  Peter Liguori, a Tribune Co. board member and former FoxBroadcasting Co. chairman, is expected to be the new chiefexecutive officer when current CEO Eddy Hartenstein gives up hisposition after the companys next board meeting, Vitanza said.  Liguori, 52, who was named to Yahoo! Inc.s board earlierthis year, is a consultant at private equity firm  Carlyle GroupLP (CG)  and previously served as  Discovery Communications Inc. (DISCA) schief operating officer.  Advertising Slump  Gary Weitman , a Tribune spokesman, declined to comment.  Tribune Co. filed for bankruptcy after Zell, a real-estatedeveloper, orchestrated an $8.3 billion leveraged buyout of thecompany in 2007, just before a global recession and a slump inprint advertising devastated the newspaper industry.  The buyout loaded Tribune Co. with debt, and Zell failed topull off a turnaround of the newspapers. He put the company intobankruptcy in December 2008, triggering a court fight betweenbondholders who held Tribunes pre-buyout debt and the lenderswho funded the takeover. A settlement approved by the  bankruptcycourt  allowed the older creditors to try to recover some oftheir losses by pursuing lawsuits against shareholders andmanagers, including Zell.  In November, Tribune Co. won approval from the FederalCommunications Commission to transfer its television and radiolicenses to new owners -- including  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,Oaktree Capital Management LP and Angelo, Gordon & Co. -- thelast hurdle to emerging from bankruptcy. U.S. Bankruptcy JudgeKevin Carey accepted Tribunes proposal to divide ownership ofthe newspaper and television company among its lenders in July.  New Owners  Asset sales will be the quickest way JPMorgan, Oaktree andAngelo, Gordon & Co. can profit from their new ownership stakes,Vitanza said.  They will get maximum value by breaking the company intolittle pieces and selling it off piecemeal, Vitanza said.  The companys owners have been seeking an adviser for apossible sale of at least some of its newspapers, peoplefamiliar with the situation said earlier this month.  Rupert Murdoch , chairman and CEO of  News Corp. (NWSA) , plans to take a closelook at Tribune Co.s newspaper assets once theyre available,according to a person with knowledge of his thinking.  Tribune Co.s board -- Bruce Karsh, Ken Liang, PeterMurphy,  Ross Levinsohn , Craig A. Jacobson, Liguori andHartenstein -- will meet in the next several weeks, the companysaid. The directors will ratify the companys executive officersat that time. Until then, Hartenstein will remain in the CEOjob, Tribune Co. said.  Tribune emerges from the bankruptcy process as a multi-media company with a great mix of profitable assets, strongbrands in major markets and a much-improved capital structure,Hartenstein said in the statement.

Austrian steelmaker  Voestalpine AG (VOE)  said Dec. 19 it may construct a 500 million-euro ($661 million) factory in the U.S. to benefit from cheap gas.  Nucor Corp. (NUE) , the most valuable U.S. steelmaker, plans to start up a $750 million Louisiana project in mid-2013. Theyre among at least five U.S. plants under consideration or being built that would use gas instead of coal to purify iron ore, the main ingredient in steel.  That technology has been around 30 years, but for 29 years gas prices in the U.S. were so high that the technology was not economical, said Michelle Applebaum, managing partner at consulting firm Steel Market Intelligence in  Chicago . This is how steel will be built moving forward.  The new capacity may signal a turnaround for an industry that has suffered from overcapacity since the financial crisis and collapse in commodity prices four years ago. U.S. steelmakers have struggled to stay profitable amid sluggish domestic demand, depressed prices and competition from Chinese imports. While  global steel output  has grown by 14 percent since 2008, U.S. production has shrunk 3.4 percent.  Gas Plunge  The newest group of steel projects are so-called direct-reduced iron plants, which account for the first stage of steelmaking. DRI technology produces iron for about $324 a ton, Nucor said in a November presentation. Thats $82 a ton, or 20 percent, cheaper than using a conventional blast furnace, the  Charlotte , North Carolina-based steelmaker said.  Foreign competitors are now following Nucors lead. A joint venture between  Australia s  Bluescope Steel Ltd. (BSL)  and commodity trader Cargill Inc. plans to build a DRI plant in  Ohio , Biliana Pehlivanova and Shiyang Wang, analysts at Barclays Plc in New York, said in a Dec. 18 report.  India s Essar Global Ltd. plans one for  Minnesota , Barclays said.  Nucor may announce a second DRI plant as soon as 2013, bringing the companys domestic iron-making capacity to 5 million tons per year, according to Aldo Mazzaferro, a steel analyst at Macquarie Capital USA Inc. in New York. Nucor agreed last month to pay Canadian energy company Encana Corp. $3 billion over two decades for a joint venture that will develop gas wells to supply its DRI capacity.  No one at BlueScope and Essar responded to messages seeking comment on the DRI projects.  Lisa Clemens , a Cargill spokeswoman, declined to comment about any iron-making expansion at the companys North Star BlueScope joint venture. Katherine Miller, a Nucor spokeswoman, declined to comment about a possible second DRI plant.  Chemical Boom  Hydraulic fracturing of shale rock formations from  Texas  to West Virginia has boosted supplies of gas and sent prices plunging by as much as half in the past two years. Gas futures reached a decade low of $1.91 per million British thermal units in April in New York trading.  The shale revolution is triggering an avalanche of industrial expansion plans, Barclays Pehlivanova and Wang said.  Theres been a reversal of fortune for U.S. chemical producers after years of decline. Shares of LyondellBasell Industries NV have more than doubled since it emerged from bankruptcy in 2010. The company is now among chemical producers planning billions of dollars of plants around the Gulf of Mexico to capitalize on cheaper gas. Fertilizer companies including CF Industries Holdings Inc. also are planning to construct gas-fueled plants.  Gas Exports?  Other companies from around the world that consume gas may be attracted to move their facilities to the U.S. market, which would then provide even more steel consumption and manufacturing capacity, said Macquaries Mazzaferro. It could result in a re-industrialization of the U.S.  Still, gas may not get much cheaper from here. Prices are up 75 percent from their April low and will average $3.70 per million British thermal units next year, or about 31 percent more than in 2012, according to the median of 21 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Gas for February delivery fell 3.4 percent to settle at $3.351 per million British thermal units in New York.  That price trend may continue if the U.S. starts exports. A Dec. 5 study by NERA Economic Consulting found that the country would benefit more from shipping liquefied natural gas than using it all domestically. Sempra Energy and Exxon Mobil Corp. are among energy companies seeking export permits.  Vanishing Profits  At the same time, theres no guarantee that steel demand in the U.S. will improve. Domestic steel-industry capacity utilization is at 74 percent, according to data from the American Iron and Steel Institute. Utilization was 91 percent in August 2008, the month before the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  Steelmakers earnings havent recovered. Nucor will post a $504 million net income for this year, according to the average of seven analysts estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Thats less than a third of what the company earned in 2008. U.S. Steel Corp., the countrys biggest producer by volume, is expected to post a fourth consecutive  annual loss .  The price of hot-rolled steel coil, a benchmark product, has averaged $646 a ton this year, compared with $693 in 2011, according to data from Steel Business Briefing.  Blast Furnaces  Iron is the largest component of steel. While its the fourth most abundant element in the earths crust, iron is rarely found in its elemental form and must instead be separated from other minerals, or reduced in steel industry terminology.  For steelmakers, the process typically occurs in a blast furnace, in which coal heats and reduces iron ore. That method accounts for 94 percent of global iron output, according to the World Steel Association.  While Nucor will use DRI iron in  Louisiana  at its electric arc furnaces, the final stage of its steelmaking process, the company will still get most of its raw material from scrap steel. The DRI iron doesnt just provide a cost advantage: It also helps to make smoother, blemish-free steel thats stronger and more ductile. Recycling steel is vulnerable to swings in scrap supply and quality.  The future is unknown when it comes to raw materials, Nucor Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dan DiMicco said in a Nov. 13 interview. DiMicco is due to stand down as CEO tomorrow after 12 years in the job and become executive chairman, with John J. Ferriola taking over as CEO.  We said, Hey we should take advantage of this to generate long-term stability, DiMicco said, referring to DRI.

I would imagine that next week theyre going to behere, he said yesterday on a state-controlled radio andtelevision show, according to  Agencia Boliviana de Informacion ,a state-owned news service. Were going to talk, always in acordial atmosphere, to see in what way we can arrive at atransition that is favorable for both sides.  Morales has moved to put the telecommunications, energy andwater industries under state control since taking power in 2006.In June, the government nationalized the Colquiri tin and zincmine owned by  Glencore International Plc. (GLEN)   As in past takeovers, Bolivian authorities seized severalbuildings from the Iberdrola units in La Paz, Argentine CN23 TVshowed. Employees didnt oppose their entrance.

Assuming there will be no news of compensation forIberdrola the shares will close lower, Gonzalo Sanchez- Bordona, an analyst at  Banco BPI SA (BPI) , said in a telephoneinterview from Madrid.  The takeover comes seven months after Bolivia expropriatedassets of Spains  Red Electrica Corp. (REE) , which is still in theprocess of being compensated by the government.  This provides, in our view, little hope for Iberdrola toreach a quick agreement, Sanchez-Bordana said.  The latest seizure follows a series of Spanish companytakeovers by Latin American governments, as Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  took control of oil company YPFSA when her government seized 51 percent of the companys sharesfrom Spains  Repsol YPF SA (REP)  in April.

The nation will step up efforts to promote strong, sustainable and balanced growth in the world economy, Hu said in the speech broadcast by state radio and television. China achieved stable economic development in 2012 and will seek to do the same this year while making restructuring of its growth model a focus, he said.  Hus last New Years Eve address before he steps down as president in March signaled Chinese leaders confidence the economy may be rebounding after a seven-quarter slowdown. A recovery may facilitate the transfer of power to Xi Jinping, appointed head of the Communist Party in November and set to become president, as authorities seek to assuage discontent sparked by corruption and a widening income gap.  The Chinese people are now uniting around the leadership of Xi to work toward building a well-off society, Hu said.  Chinas new Communist Party leaders have pledged to abandon extravagance, cut down on lavish receptions and live more frugally, amid a broader push to stamp out corruption and win back peoples trust.  Hus speech didnt indicate how China, set to complete its once-a-decade leadership transition in March, plans to manage an economy thats estimated to expand 8.1 percent this year.  Monetary Policy  Peoples Bank of China Governor  Zhou Xiaochuan , in a separate New Years Eve statement posted on the central banks website, said the nation will maintain prudent monetary policy and deepen financial reforms in 2013. Policy makers will seek to effectively prevent financial risks and keep prices basically stable, he said.  In another statement on the PBOC website, Zhou said the nations management of its foreign exchange reserves had seen stable growth in returns during the past few years. The global economic situation will remain complicated in 2013 and Chinas management of its reserves will face relatively large challenges, he said.  Chinas  foreign exchange reserves  increased to $3.29 trillion at the end of September from $3.18 trillion at the end of 2011, according to central bank data.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  has rebounded 15 percent since reaching an almost four-year low on Dec. 3 amid optimism Chinas economic growth will recover. It gained 3.2 percent in 2012, its first annual advance in three years.  Manufacturing Expands  A gauge of Chinas manufacturing showed a third month of expansion, adding evidence that the economic rebound will extend into the new year. The Purchasing Managers Index was 50.6 in December, the National Bureau of Statistics and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said today in Beijing. That compares with the 51.0 median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 27 analysts and 50.6 in November. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  A separate gauge yesterday showed manufacturing expanded at the fastest pace in 19 months in December, according to HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics. The final reading was 51.5.  In his speech, Hu also said China sought long-term prosperity in Hong Kong and Macau and for the two so-called Special Administrative Regions to be self-governing.

A lack of prime properties available for purchase andlimited lending by U.K. banks means investors with cash willstart developing properties in central London in 2013, and thosebuildings will be in demand when theyre completed, the companyforecast. Development tends to generate greater potentialreturns than investments in completed buildings with rent-payingtenants in place.  Given the limited finance for this type of activity,pricing will be competitive for those with equity and thereforewe expect to see more overseas capital looking for opportunitiesto partner with local specialists and fund prime developments,Jones Lang said.

Bank of America Corp. ,  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) ,  JPMorgan Chase &Co. (JPM)  and New York-based  Citigroup Inc. (C)  are among servicers thatmay make concessions totaling about $10 billion, said thepeople, who requested anonymity because the discussions areprivate. The funds would compensate borrowers whose homes werewrongfully seized using faulty paperwork and aid homeowners indanger of default, the people said.  The penalties would supplant a system allowing borrowerswho lost homes in 2009 and 2010 to seek compensation afterforeclosure reviews. The program, which housing advocates saidfailed to reach its intended targets, was set up under consentdecrees the banks signed with regulators in 2011. It drew356,000 applicants out of what the advocates said were 4.4million eligible borrowers. Today is the application deadlineand no borrowers have yet received compensation, the OCC said.  Theyre trying to fix a system that was faulty from thebeginning,  Ira Rheingold , executive director of the NationalAssociation of Consumer Advocates, said in a phone interview.The people in charge created a program that was not designedto help homeowners.  Theyve been trying in fits and starts toimprove it. I think at some point they threw up their hands andsaid, This is not working.  Federal Reserve  An announcement of the new enforcement action could come assoon as this week, the people said. The  New York  Times reportedon the $10 billion figure in todays editions.  Robert Garsson, a spokesman for the OCC, declined tocomment on a potential agreement with banks. He said the agencywould continue working to compensate homeowners who have appliedfor relief under the consent decrees. Spokesmen for the otherregulators involved in the process, the  Federal Reserve  and theFederal Deposit Insurance Corp., also declined to comment.  The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency iscommitted to ensuring the Independent Foreclosure Reviewproceeds efficiently and to ensuring harmed borrowers arecompensated as quickly as possible, Garsson said in an e-mail.  Dan Frahm , a spokesman for  Charlotte , North Carolina-basedBank of America,  Amy Bonitatibus  at New York-based JPMorgan,Vickee Adams at Wells Fargo in  San Francisco  and Citigroups Mark Rodgers  declined to comment.  Eligible Borrowers  Its too soon to tell whether the new agreement betweenbanks and regulators will leave more money in consumers pocketsthan the so-called independent foreclosure reviews, housingadvocates said. If all eligible borrowers had applied for andreceived compensation after the reviews, banks could have paidout far more than $10 billion, the advocates said. Theagreements allowed homeowners to get as much as $125,000 plusthe value of lost home equity.  All of the problems with the process that we outlined forover a year made it clear that it was unlikely that seriouscompensation would come out of that without changes, said Alys Cohen, staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center.Changes could have been made but werent, and in light of thatits important to get bank payments into the hands ofhomeowners.  The 2011 enforcement actions required lenders to strengthensystems for handling foreclosure documents and communicatingwith borrowers who are behind on payments. Banks were forced tohire independent reviewers to probe wrongdoing in home seizures.  Home Seizures  As consumer advocates complained about a lack ofinteraction with borrowers, banks were saddled with costs fromhiring independent reviewers such as PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPand Promontory Financial Group LLC. Under the agreement, thosefirms reviewed samples of 2009 and 2010 foreclosures while anyborrower who felt wronged could also file a complaint.  The deal with the OCC is among other efforts by federal andstate governments to hold banks accountable for botched homeseizures.  Separately, U.S. state attorneys general and federalauthorities are continuing to press regional banks to accept asettlement over mishandled foreclosure documents similar to adeal reached with larger competitors this year, according topeople briefed on the talks.  U.S. Bancorp,  PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (PNC) ,  SunTrustBanks Inc. (STI)  and London-based  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  have held talkswith state and federal officials who investigated claims thatloan servicers mishandled foreclosure documents.  Robo-Signing  State attorneys general led by  Tom Miller , an IowaDemocrat, began an investigation of mortgage servicers inOctober 2010 after reports that practices including robo-signing had led to improper foreclosures. The probe culminatedin a $25 billion settlement in February among the five biggestservicers -- Wells Fargo, JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroupand Detroit-based Ally Financial Inc. -- and 49 states and thefederal government.  Our negotiations with additional servicers are ongoing,said Geoff Greenwood, a spokesman for Miller.  The deal with the largest servicers compensates borrowerswho lost their homes to foreclosures, forgives debt, givespayment forbearances, arranges short sales and refinancesmortgages at lower rates. It also specifies new standards forfair servicing of mortgages. In return, the banks receivedlimited protection from independent litigation.

The price may touch $300 per 1,000 board feet in 2013, Paul F. Jannke, a principal at the Westford, Massachusetts-basedconsulting  company , said in a telephone interview on Dec. 27. Inmid-October, he correctly forecast the rally. Futures on theChicago Mercantile Exchange on Dec. 26 reached $399.50, thehighest since April 2005.  Were pretty close to the peak, Jannke said. Theinitial spike tends to be the highest, then production ramps up.If the mills increase shifts from a 40-hour week to a 50-hourweek, thats a big jump, and everybody is ratcheting up theirwork weeks.  As the U.S. housing market rebounded this year, lumberprices soared 44 percent, the biggest annual gain since 1993.That topped the 24  raw materials  in the Standard & Poors GSCISpot Index, led by a 19 percent rally in wheat futures in Chicago .  U.S. building permits, a proxy for future construction,rose to an annual rate of 900,000 in November, the highest infour years, government data shows. That helped boost the sharesof lumber producers including  Weyerhaeuser (WY)  Co. and Plum CreekTimber Co.  Weyerhaeusers plants werent running at full capacity thisyear, and the company may increase production to meet demand,Chief Executive Officer Daniel Fulton said on a conference callon Oct. 26. The company is cautious on U.S. housing andprospects for demand in China and  Europe , he said.  Chinas Economy  A leading index for Chinas economy rose at a slower pacein November, signaling limits on a rebound.  Gross domesticproduct  in the third quarter expanded 7.4 percent, the lowestsince the first quarter of 2009.  China , the consumer of 10 percent of the worlds softwoodlumber, reduced imports of logs and lumber by 19 percent in theeight months ended Aug. 31 from a year earlier, Wood ResourcesInternational LLC in Bothell,  Washington , said in October.  Lumber was the top commodity pick for 2013 at ScotiabankGroup because rising demand in the U.S. and China will straintight supplies. Substantial mill closures across NorthAmerica since 2006 set the stage for a multiple-year recovery,the Toronto-based bank said in a statement on Dec. 20.  The average cash price of lumber will be $360 per 1,000board feet in 2013, up from $298 in 2012,  Patricia Mohr , aScotiabank economist, said in an e-mail on Dec. 27.  Tremendous Crash  Demand from China is ebbing because builders made regularpurchases in the second half of 2012,  Shawn Hackett , thepresident at Hackett Financial Advisors Inc. in Boynton Beach, Florida , said in a telephone interview on Dec. 27. Risingproduction from mills in North America will drive prices lowerin 2013, he said.  We are heading for a tremendous crash in the lumbermarket, Hackett said. Weve gotten way overdone to theupside. This is the time to be a bear.  Lumber futures for March delivery fell 2.5 percent to closeat $375.10 at 1:07 p.m. in Chicago. In the fourth quarter, theprice jumped 34 percent, the most in two years.  Shares of Weyerhaeuser, based in Federal Way, Washington,rose 0.9 percent to $27.82. They soared 49 percent this year.

Please refer to weeklyLM_XB459 as the item may qualify.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  A cutout value is an average of the prices tallied for cuts of beef from cattle carcasses weighing 550-850 pounds. Cutout values are separated into three main product types. Fabricated loads are beef cuts taken from an animal's ribs, chuck, round, loin, brisket, short plateand flank; 50 percent loads are 50 percent lean beef trimmings. Ground loads may contain 73, 75, or 80 percent ground beef. A typical refrigerated truckload carries 40,000 pounds.  Choice 1-3 grade is a better grade than Select 1-3, partly becauseChoice cuts have more fat, or marbling, than Select cuts.  Grade quality is determined using a 1-5 yield grade scale. A ratingof 1 is the highest ratio of muscle to fat, while 5 is the lowest.   Marbling is an important flavor factor."}, {"title": "USDA Boxed Beef Cutout Midday Prices for December 31", "date": "2012-12-31", "time": "17:08:40", "content": "     December 31 (Bloomberg)  -- This table details boxed beef cutoutprices supplied daily by the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .Prices and loads traded are as of 11:30 a.m. U.S. central time.

Cutout values are separated into three main product types. Fabricated loads are beef cuts taken from an animal's ribs, chuck, round, loin, brisket, short plateand flank; 50 percent loads are 50 percent lean beef trimmings. Ground loads may contain 73, 75, or 80 percent ground beef. A typical refrigerated truckload carries 40,000 pounds.  Choice 1-3 grade is a better grade than Select 1-3, partly becauseChoice cuts have more fat, or marbling, than Select cuts.  Grade quality is determined using a 1-5 yield grade scale. A ratingof 1 is the highest ratio of muscle to fat, while 5 is the lowest.   Marbling is an important flavor factor."}, {"title": "UT Bank Heads for 16-Month High on 2012 Performance: Accra Mover", "date": "2012-12-31", "time": "14:49:15", "content": "UT Bank Ghana Ltd.

The resulting struggle between coal managers eager for a profit and miners desperate for a fair wage was symptomatic of an industry torn apart by the worsening economic crisis. At an Interstate Commerce Commission hearing, a railroad-fuel agent said he had bought some coal from  Pennsylvania  for 72 cents a ton. Five years earlier, the price had been more than $2. National soft-coal production was 300 million tons, slightly more than half the total output in 1926. Consequently, soft-coal employment had slipped by a third by 1932 -- to 400,000 men from 600,000. To lower costs and reduce the influence of the United Mine Workers of America union, mine operators fired workers and cut wages. Few miners had skills that would transfer elsewhere in an economy already beset by high unemployment. Both spontaneous walkouts and organized strikes spread across Appalachian coal districts. When mine operators recruited replacements for workers on strike, protests routinely turned into violent confrontations. State police and National Guard units often had to break up demonstrations to ensure strikebreakers access to the mine shafts. Miners also battled among themselves: The rekindling of an old family feud in Kentucky resulted in nine deaths in early July. Summer meetings between mine operators and union leaders to end the strikes stalled at first, but then the  Justice Department   filed  an antitrust lawsuit against 136 coal companies. The suit alleged that these companies, which controlled about 70 percent of Appalachias mines, had conspired to fix prices. (The  Supreme Court  would later rule that there was no reason for injunction against the companies.) In July,  Illinois  operators and the miners' union agreed to make wage cuts averaging 15 percent in exchange for reopening mines to re-employ an estimated 40,000 workers. Miners  rejected  the pact by a 4-to-1 margin, denouncing the pay reduction. In December, after a tough debate, the miners  accepted  a two-year basic wage deal of $5 a day. That was the only good news for miners that December. Three deadly accidents occurred in the weeks before Christmas. First, a Dec. 7 gas explosion three miles inside a  Madrid ,  New Mexico , mine killed 14 men. The early-morning blast consumed all the oxygen in the gallery, suffocating them. \"Many were found with their lunch pails in their hands,\" the Albuquerque Journal reported. \"Others had not even taken off their coats to begin work. Two days later, a blast at Zero Mine in  Kentucky  killed 23, including two pairs of brothers. One family lost six sons. All were married with children. Then, on Christmas Eve, a detonation rocked Moweaqua mine in Illinois. Fallen shale blocked passages half a mile inside. Fifty miners who were close to the entrance escaped unhurt; the 54 deeper inside died. \"Attempts by a score of men to dig through the shaft with picks and shovels were hampered by the hysterical wives and children of the imprisoned men,\" the Alton Evening Telegraph reported. In three weeks, coal-mining accidents had resulted in 91 fatalities and ripped apart communities. It had been a terrible year in many ways, but the December mining disasters were really too much.

The answer dates back at least 1,500years. And it involves a mix of history, location and -- notleast -- skillful marketing.  In the late fifth century, King Clovis, the reigningmonarch of northern  France , was fighting to defend histerritory. Legend has it that he promised his wife, theBurgundian princess Clotilde, that if he won his next battle, hewould convert to Christianity. He won, and in 496 he wasbaptized in a church in the city of Reims, in the heart ofFrances Champagne region.  For centuries afterward, kings of France were crowned inReims, eventually at a great cathedral built there. Beforetrains and cars, trekking out to Reims was a major undertaking.So, after a coronation, the royal court would linger in theChampagne region for a while, and partake of the local wines.  In the Middle Ages, the wine world was very different fromwhat it is today. Like other agricultural products, wine wascommonly consumed within a year after it was produced. Grapeswere harvested and fermented for a few weeks, then exportedduring the fall and winter, usually shipped in barrels. Thewines of Champagne at the time were still, not effervescent aschampagne is today.  Fizzy Wine  As the trade picked up over the centuries, and more andmore wine was exported, sometimes new barrels werent openeduntil spring -- when the wine inside would be fizzy. Thishappened because the yeasts that had been fermenting the winewent dormant when the cold weather arrived in the fall. As theweather warmed, the yeasts woke up and started consuming thegrape sugars left in the wine. Alcohol is one of the byproductsof yeasts fermenting grape juice. Another is carbon dioxide, thesame stuff that carbonates soda. When fermentation occurs in aclosed container, the carbon dioxide infuses the liquid andforms sparkling wine.  Although this process was happening in other wine regions,Champagne had several advantages. Its major towns were locatedon rivers at a time when water was the shipping highway of theworld. And the region supplied wine not only to the French courtin Paris but also to England and Holland -- coastal areas toofar north to grow their own grapes -- where sparkling wine wasgaining in popularity.  Enter the famous monk  Dom Perignon , at the end of the 17thcentury. Perignon didnt actually invent champagne, but heimproved the quality of his abbeys vineyards and its wine. Asdemand for effervescent wine grew, he began packaging theproduct in bottles, helping to maintain its sparkle. He alsofigured out how to stopper the bottles with corks, and how tosecure the corks with string.  In 1728, King Louis XV, a champagne fan, decreed that onlyChampagnes wines could be shipped in bottles; other Frenchwines were to be shipped in barrels. This made it possible forChampagnes merchants to reliably deliver sparkling wine totheir customers. At the time, quite a bit of champagne wasconsumed at the French court. In addition to being fun, it wasconsidered a light and beneficial beverage.  Seeing a ready market, merchants in Champagne beganswitching over from wool, cloth and other local commodities tosparkling wine.  It wasnt easy. Champagnes complicated production andaging methods, along with variable glass quality, meant that agreat deal of wine was often wasted. Many cellar workers alsosuffered injuries or even death when they were hit by explodingbottles, or slipped on the rivers of champagne created whenblocks of stacked bottles shattered in underground agingcaverns. The early producers who succeeded probably were morelucky than careful.  They were also relentless marketers. With champagne knownto please the courts of France and England, producers beganpromoting their sparkling wines in the other major cities ofEurope -- even going as far as Russia and the U.S.  Aspirational Beverage  At first, royal favor made champagne an easy sell to thenobility. But with the rise of industrialization in the 19thcentury, the nobles were no longer guaranteed to be thewealthiest consumers. Champagne producers dangled their productsin front of the newly rich merchant class: an aspirationalbeverage. Of course, these new customers couldnt afford todrink champagne every day, but they could afford it on specialoccasions. Soon they began ordering it for all celebrations.Champagne became de rigueur at festivities from weddings to shipchristenings -- to ringing in the New Year.  New Years Eve celebrations probably originated millenniaago as religious ceremonies, part of solstice rituals. Andassociating drink with religious observances has endured as atradition since pagans made offerings to their gods with aspecial mead or wine. Over the ensuing centuries, as New YearsEve evolved from a religious festivity to a secular one, theconcept of a drink fine enough for the gods became intertwinedwith champagnes reputation as a celebratory extravagance. Andthat reputation is what champagne marketers continue to offer.The drinks status has been maintained for centuries byintentional association with opulence.  Plus, its fun. We enjoy seeing the froth of the wine as itfills our glass, and we delight in watching the magicallyrenewing bubbles as we drink. Champagne tingles on the tongue,and its fizz seems to carry aromas and flavors straight to ourheads.  Even so, people rarely drink too much champagne. Inaddition to price considerations, its not easy to consumebubbles fast -- except, perhaps, on New Years Eve.

The extraterrestrial terroir taste in Meteorito, a cabernetmade at  Chile s  Tremonte  winery, comes from a 4.5-billion-year-old meteorite from the asteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars.  Winery general manager Ian Hutcheon, owner of the nearby Centro Astronomico Tagua Tagua  and anxious to join his twopassions, submerged the 3-inch space rock in some of his 2010cabernet for a year.

The  Ardbeg  whisky distillery on the Scottish island ofIslay, on the other hand, announced that it had sent plasticvials of unaged single malt molecules where no dram had gonebefore: the international space station, 250 miles above earth.  The mission: a two-year study with space research companyNanoRacks LLC to see how the famously peaty spirit ages in nearzero-G. The cost to find out how complex flavor molecules calledterpenes interact with charred oak in this atmosphere ishalf a million dollars.  Will all this result in new aromas and flavors for a space-inspired whisky? Well beam down the results in 2013.  Spaces vast potential for wine and spirits was only onehighlight among 2012s weird and wacky stories.  Robot Rack  An over-the-top wine rack in the style of a giantTransformer  robot  toy is posted on Craigslist for $7,000. Sixfeet tall, weighing 1,000 pounds and made from old automobileand motorcycle transmission parts in  China , its billed by its Arizona  owner as ridiculously cool.  Most of the 32 welded bottle slots store wines vertically,so it isnt ideal for super pricy wines, but perfect for thefan-boy geek who has everything. First posted in June, itsstill available.  The French designers of a cute vine-pruning, data-collecting robot named  Wall-Ye V.I.N. , which debuted inSeptember, are now taking orders. Red with white trim, Wall-Yeis 20 inches tall and has two arms, four wheels and six cameras.  Its solar-powered, doesnt get tired, drunk, or go onstrike, and costs 25,000 euros ($33,100). Chateau MoutonRothschild offered its prestigious vineyards for test runs,according to Agence France Presse.  Wine Perfume  The newest wine pairing is with perfume, long a no-no combofor serious tasters. After being called out by a winemaker atNapa Valleys Rombauer Vineyards for wearing a vanilla scent,fragrance marketer  Kelly Jones  set herself the task of makingfive perfumes, introduced in 2012, that she says enhance wine.  I didnt want scents to smell like wine spilled on myshirt, Jones said in a telephone interview. For Notes ofMerlot I picked up on the varietals whiffs of candiedviolet.  Others may prefer to try out new mini-aerosol flavor-sprayfor the mouth,  Wahh Quantum Sensations , which provides afleeting feeling of drunkenness without the harmful effects ofalcohol. Designer Philippe Starck and Harvard Universityscientist David Edwards say the purpose is to accent life witha magic wand.  2012 was also a year of strange wines we definitely dontneed, like  Almond Roca  cream dessert wine from Washington State,which takes chocolate-infused wines to a new, treacly level.  Nude Prince  U.K. merchant Sheldons Wine Cellars offers theuncomplicated, easy-drinking 2011  Royal Blush Rose , with alabel based on nude Prince Harry photos taken at an August bare-it-all-party in Las Vegas.

Dr. Ruth says the obvious -- that wine helps couples relaxand get aroused, but too much impairs performance. Which is whyshe wanted her wines to have a weak 6 percent alcohol. Fiftyshades of chutzpah!  Eroticism is also key to the just-launched G-Spirits lineof vodka, single malt whisky, and rum, created by formerbartenders Maximilian and Julian Goldbach in  Germany .  Beforebottling, every single drop of booze is poured over the nakedbreasts of beautiful women, like Hungarian playmate of the yearAlexa Varga, to give the taste a unique erotic character.  X-Rated Labels  According to Max Goldbach, their customers, mostly men(surprise!), range from 18 to 72. Lest you are worried about howsanitary this is, the website claims that medical personnelsupervise. The labels are X-rated, which is why youll have togo to the website to view.  Maybe G-Spirits call for the nuttiest wine accessory of2012,  Vinderpants .

We know that taxes are going to rise, and so will the federal debt. We know that there will be more guns in circulation at the end of the year than at the beginning. We know that Donald Trump will get attention for saying something boorish.  It will also be a year of unexpected setbacks for President  Barack Obama s health-care law. (Unexpected, that is, except by readers of this column.) Its supporters may believe that with the Supreme Court having mostly upheld the plan, and Democrats having kept control of the White House and Senate, the law is no longer vulnerable to attack. It is still, however, vulnerable to its own flaws.  Predictions: Premiums will go up, especially for young people. The Washington Posts  recent report  that Obamacare exchanges will open for business on Oct. 1 will be proved false when Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius admits the federal government wont be ready by then. The Obama administration will propose further delaying the law. Democratic hopes that it will one day prove popular will continue to be frustrated.  The controversy over contraceptives and Catholic institutions isnt going away because of the election, either. Most federal courts will rule that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act means that employers with religious objections to covering contraceptives and abortion drugs -- even employers who arent running religious organizations -- cant be forced to do it.  The Supreme Court wont decide that the Constitution requires state governments to recognize same-sex marriage. It wont rule out the possibility that it includes that requirement, either. Instead, it will find a way not to settle that issue.  Taxes, Unreformed  There will be no tax reform, because members of Congress will look at the biggest breaks in the tax code and  realize  that they dont actually want to get rid of any of them. There will also be no corporate-tax reform, because small business and big business dont see  eye to eye on it . There will be another debt- limit fight, which will cause another credit downgrade that will again have no detectible influence on the markets in labor, stocks or credit.  The Syrian regime will fall, and hopes for a liberal future in that country will fade just as quickly as they are fading in  Egypt .  Japan  and South Korea will adopt increasingly independent, and militaristic, foreign policies in their region.  In happier news, the continuing economic trouble in  Europe  will become a smaller and smaller problem for the global economy. The main reason: The U.S., the U.K. and Japan are all moving toward a  new monetary regime  that limits the effects of demand shocks.  There are typically only a few high-profile political races in the years after presidential elections: those for governor of New Jersey and  Virginia  and for mayor of New York. Political reporters tend to invest the first two of those with outsized importance as indicators of political trends. This year they will get a split decision, with Republican Chris Christie winning re-election in New Jersey and Democrat Terry McAuliffe narrowly winning in Virginia.  Christies victory in a solidly blue state will renew speculation about a presidential run in 2016. He will have a lot of company in the rumor mill, because no Republican has a sufficiently strong national network to push other candidates out of the field the way  Mitt Romney  did in the last campaign. One subplot sure to get an increasing amount of media attention is tension between Senators Marco Rubio of  Florida  and Ted Cruz of  Texas . Both are Cuban-American Republicans thought to have presidential ambitions; however either feels about the other, those ambitions will collide.  Ryan, Clinton  Representative Paul Ryan of  Wisconsin  will find that the constraints of serving in the U.S. House make it impossible for him to mount a serious presidential campaign. He will therefore resign, saying he wants to promote new conservative ideas from outside Congress. Ohio Governor John Kasich, rebounding from low poll numbers, will start exploring a presidential run of his own.  A slew of Catholic Democrats -- Vice President Joe Biden, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Maryland Governor Martin OMalley among them -- will wait to see Hillary Clintons plans before deciding whether to run. In another close contest, Illinois and  California  will compete to see which of the blue states can go bankrupt first.  And the entire Internet will crash when it is revealed that Kate Middleton is having twins.  I havent gone out far on any limbs in this column. Still, if any of these predictions prove mistaken, Im not giving you a refund.

We have proposed to the Ministry of Finance that themining fees be reduced by 50 percent, he said in a Dec. 28interview from Harare, the capital. Were now waiting for theMinistry of Finance to approve the new fee structure, which willhappen in the new year.  Zimbabwe, which has the biggest platinum and chromereserves after  South Africa , in February raised diamond-mininglicenses to $5 million from $1 million, while an application fora platinum-mining license climbed to $500,000 from $200,according to the Government Gazette. The government, which saidthe revised fees were meant to deter speculative holdings ofmineral claims, in April said it planned to review the dutiesfollowing complaints.  The country is trying to boost revenue from mining andother industries as it seeks to recover from a decade-longrecession that ended in 2009 when neighboring countries brokeredthe formation of a coalition government to ease a politicaldispute between President  Robert Mugabe s Zimbabwe AfricanNational Union-Patriotic Front part and the Movement forDemocratic Change of Prime Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai .  Impala, which is based in Johannesburg and and controlsZimbabwes biggest platinum operation, said on Feb. 16 that theincrease in fees will cost $1 billion and bankrupt the countrysmining industry.  Diamonds, Gold  The decision to raise fees has harmed the outlook for theindustry, the countrys Chamber of Mines, whose members includeImpalas Zimplats unit, London-based  Rio Tinto Group (RIO) ,  China sSinosteel Corp. and closely held Metallon Corp Ltd., said onDec. 3.
